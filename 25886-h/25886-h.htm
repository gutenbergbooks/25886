<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN DE BANYAN AND OTHERS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir; but I see, by the number
on your cap, that we belong to the same regiment,&#8221;
said an officer with two bars on his shoulder-straps,
as he halted in the aisle of the railroad-car,
near where Lieutenant Thomas Somers was
seated. &#8220;May I be permitted to inquire whom I
have the honor of addressing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, of the &mdash;&mdash;th Massachusetts,&#8221;
replied the young gentleman addressed, as
he politely touched his cap in return for the salutation
of the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! is it possible? I am rejoiced to meet you.
I have heard of you before. Allow me to add in
the most delicate manner, that you are a good fellow,
a first-rate soldier, and as brave an officer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
as ever sported a pair of shoulder-straps. Permit
me to offer you my hand; and allow me to add,
that it is a hand which was never sullied by a dishonorable
act.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to make your acquaintance,&#8221; replied
Lieutenant Somers, as he accepted the offered
hand. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you take a seat, Captain&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan, at your service,&#8221; continued
the officer, as he seated himself by the side of the
young lieutenant, who was completely bewildered
by the elegant and courtly speech of his new-found
friend.
</p>
<p>If Lieutenant Somers needs any further introduction
to the reader, we may briefly add, that he
was a native of Pinchbrook, a town near Boston,
in the State of Massachusetts. He was now entering
his eighteenth year, and had enlisted in the
great army of the Union as a private, with an
earnest and patriotic desire to serve his imperiled
country in her death-grapple with treason and
traitors. He had won his warrant as a sergeant
by bravery and address, and had subsequently been
commissioned as a second lieutenant for good conduct
on the bloody field of Williamsburg, where he
had been wounded. The injury he had received,
and the exhaustion consequent upon hard marching
and the excitement of a terrible battle, had
procured for him a furlough of thirty days. He
had spent this brief period at home; and now, invigorated
by rest and the care of loving friends, he
was returning to the army to participate in that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
stupendous campaign which culminated in the
seven-days&#8217; battles before Richmond.
</p>
<p>Inspired by the hope of honorable distinction,
still more by the patriotic desire to serve the
noblest cause for which the soldier ever drew a
sword, he was hastening to the post of danger and
duty. As the train hurried him by smiling fields,
and through cities and villages whose prosperity
was mysteriously interlinked with the hallowed
mission which called him from the bosom of home
and friends, his thoughts were those which would
naturally animate the soul of a young patriot, as
he journeyed to the battle-fields of a nation&#8217;s ruin
or salvation. He thought of the bloody scenes before
him, of the blessed home behind him.
</p>
<p>Only the day before, he had made his parting
visit to Lilian Ashford, who knit his &#8220;fighting
socks,&#8221; as he had called them since the eventful
day when he had found her letter and her picture
in them. Of course, he could not help thinking of
her; and, as he had a thin stratum of sentiment in
his composition, it is more than probable that
the beautiful young lady monopolized more than
her fair share of his thoughts; but I am sure it was
not at all to the detriment of the affection he owed
his mother and the other dear ones, who were
shrined in the sanctuary of his heart.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers was an exceedingly good-looking
young man, which, as it was no fault of
his own, we do not object to mention. He was
clothed in his new uniform, which was very creditable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
to the taste and skill of his tailor. On his
upper lip, an incipient mustache had developed itself;
and, though it presented nothing remarkable,
it gave brilliant promise of soon becoming all that
its ambitious owner could possibly desire, especially
as he was a reasonable person, and had no
taste for monstrosities. He had paid proper attention
to this ornamental appendage, which is so indispensable
to the making-up of a soldier; and
the result, if not entirely satisfactory, was at least
hopeful.
</p>
<p>The subject of our remarks wore his sash and
belt, and carried his sword in his hand, for the
reason that he had no other convenient way of
transporting them. Our natural pride, as his biographer,
leads us to repeat that he was a fine-looking
young man; and we will venture to say,
that the young lady who occupied the seat on the
opposite side of the car was of the same opinion.
Of course, she did not stare at him; but she had
two or three times cast a furtive glance at the
young officer; though the operation had been so
well managed, that he was entirely unconscious of
the fact.
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as this same young lady was herself
quite pretty, it is not supposable that she had entirely
escaped the observation of our gallant young
son of Mars. We are compelled to say he had
glanced in that direction two or three times, to
keep within the limits of a modest calculation; but
it is our duty to add that he was not captivated,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
and that there is not the least danger of our story
degenerating into a love-tale. Lieutenant Somers
thought she was nearly as pretty as Lilian Ashford;
and this, we solemnly declare, was the entire
length and breadth of the sentiment he expended
upon the young lady, who was certainly worthy of
a deeper homage.
</p>
<p>She was in charge of an elderly, dignified gentleman,
who had occupied the seat by her side until
half an hour before the appearance of Captain de
Banyan; but, being unfortunately addicted to the
small vice of smoking, he had gone forward to the
proper car to indulge his propensity. Lieutenant
Somers had studied the faces of all the passengers
near him, and had arrived at the conclusion that
the lady&#8217;s protector was a gentleman of consequence.
He might be her father or her uncle; but
he was a member of Congress, the governor of a
State, or some high official, perhaps a major-general
in &#8220;mufti.&#8221; At any rate, our hero was interested
in the pair, and had carried his speculations
concerning them as far as theory can go without
a few facts to substantiate it, when his reflections
were disturbed by Captain de Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, I&#8217;m proud to know you, as
I had occasion to remark before. I have heard of
you. You distinguished yourself in the battle of
Williamsburg,&#8221; said Captain de Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak very handsomely of me&mdash;much better
than I deserve, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a particle, my boy. If there is a man in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
the army that can appreciate valor, that man is
Captain de Banyan. You are modest, Lieutenant
Somers&mdash;of course you are modest; all brave men
are modest&mdash;and I forgive your blushes. I&#8217;ve seen
service, my boy. Though not yet thirty-five, I
served in the Crimea, in the Forty-seventh Royal
Infantry; and was at the battles of Solferino,
Magenta, Palestro, and others too numerous to
mention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; exclaimed Lieutenant Somers, filled
with admiration by the magnificent record of the
captain. &#8220;Then you are not an American?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I am! I happened to be in England
when the Russian war commenced. So, being fond
of a stirring life, I entered as a private in the
Forty-seventh. If the war had continued six
months longer, I should have come out a brigadier-general,
though. Promotion is not so rapid in
the British army as in our own. I was at the storming
of the Redan; I was one of the first to mount
the breach. Just as I had raised my musket&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were an officer&mdash;a colonel at
least,&#8221; interposed Lieutenant Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My sword, I should have said. Just as I had
raised my sword to cut down a Russian who
threatened to bayonet me, a cannon-ball struck the
butt of my gun&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your gun?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The handle of my sword, I should have said,
and snapped it off like a pipe-stem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t it snap your hand off too?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
the lieutenant, rather bewildered by the captain&#8217;s
statements.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all; that is the most wonderful part of
the story. It didn&#8217;t even graze my skin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was very remarkable,&#8221; added Lieutenant
Somers, who could not see, for the life of him,
how a cannon-ball could hit the handle of the
sword without injuring the hand which grasped it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very remarkable, indeed; but I was reminded
of the circumstance by the remembrance
that you were hit in the head by a bullet, which
did not kill you. I shouldn&#8217;t have mentioned the
affair if I hadn&#8217;t called to mind my own experience;
for life yourself, Somers, I am a modest man;
in fact, every brave man is necessarily a modest
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you ever wounded, Captain de Banyan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, half a dozen times. At Magenta,
the same bullet passed twice through my body.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same bullet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;the same bullet. I&#8217;ll tell you how it
happened. I was in the heavy artillery there. The
bullet of the Russian&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Russian! Why, I thought the battle of
Magenta was fought between the Austrians and
the French.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, my boy. The bullet of the
Austrian, I should have said, passed through my
left lung, struck the cannon behind me, bounded
back, and hitting me again, passed through my
right lung. When it came out, it hit my musket,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
and dropped upon the ground. I picked it up, and
have it at home now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; added Lieutenant Somers in a low
whisper. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite warm to-day,&#8221; he continued,
trying to turn off the remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very warm, indeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you fall after the ball had passed
through both your lungs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I walked five miles to the hospital.
On my way, I met the Emperor Napoleon, who got
off his horse, and thanked me for the valor I had
displayed, and conferred on me the medal of the
Legion of Honor. I keep the medal in the same
bag with the bullet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have actually shaken hands with the
Emperor of France?&#8221; cried the amazed lieutenant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and King Victor Emmanuel called to see
me in the hospital, where I was confined for five
weeks. At Solferino, both their majesties shook
hands with me, and thanked me again for my services.
Being a modest man, I shouldn&#8217;t want to
say out loud that I saved the day for the French
and Sardinians at Solferino. At any rate, their
majesties did the handsome thing by me on that
day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were in the hospital five weeks
after Magenta.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I was; and well do I remember the little
delicacies sent me by the King of Italy while I lay
there on my back. Ah! that Victor Emmanuel is
a noble fellow. At Solferino, he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But how could you have been at Solferino, if
you were in the hospital five weeks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not die of my wounds, it is scarcely necessary
for me to remark. I got well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the battle of Solferino was fought on the
20th of June, and that of Magenta on the 4th of
June. There were only twenty days between the
battles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Somers. I have made some mistake
in the dates. I never was good at remembering
them. When I was in college, the professors
used to laugh at me for forgetting the date of the
Christian Era. By the way, do you smoke,
Somers? Let&#8217;s go into the smoking-car, and have
a cigar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you; I never smoke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! you are worse than a hot potato. But I
am dying for a smoke; and, if you will excuse me,
I will go forward. I will see you again before we
get to New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Captain de Banyan, apparently entirely satisfied
with himself, rose from his seat, and sauntered
gracefully forward to the door of the car, through
which he disappeared, leaving Lieutenant Somers
busy in a vain endeavor to crowd five weeks in
between the 4th and the 20th of June. The captain
was certainly a pleasant and voluble person, and
Somers had enjoyed the interview; though he could
not repress a rising curiosity to see the bullet
which had passed twice through the body of the
valiant soldier, and the medal of the Legion of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Honor conferred upon him by his imperial majesty
the Emperor of France.
</p>
<p>Some painful doubts in regard to the truth of
Captain de Banyan&#8217;s remarkable experience were
beginning to intrude themselves into his mind; and
it is quite probable that he would have been hurled
into an unhappy state of skepticism, if the train
in which he was riding had not been suddenly
hurled down an embankment some twenty feet in
height, where the cars were piled up in shapeless
wrecks, and human beings, full of life and hope
a moment before, were suddenly ushered into
eternity, or maimed and mangled for life.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE SENATOR&#8217;S DAUGHTER</h3>
</div>

<p>A scene terribly beyond the power of description
was presented to the gaze of Lieutenant
Somers when he recovered his scattered senses.
The car had been literally wrenched to pieces, and
the passengers were partially buried beneath the
fragments. Our traveler was stunned by the shock,
and made giddy by the wild vaulting of the car as
it leaped down the embankment to destruction.
He was bruised and lacerated; but he was not seriously
injured. He did not make the mistake
which many persons do under such trying circumstances,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
of believing that they are killed; or, if
their senses belie this impression, that they shall
die within a brief period.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers was endowed with a remarkable
degree of self-possession, and never gave up
anything as long as there was any chance of holding
on. He saw a great many stars not authenticated
in any respectable catalogue of celestial
luminaries. His thoughts, and even his vitality,
seemed to be suspended for an instant; but the
thoughts came back, and the stream of life still
flowed on, notwithstanding the rude assault which
had been made upon his corporal frame.
</p>
<p>Finding that he was not killed, he struggled out
from beneath the wreck which had overwhelmed
him. His first consideration, after he had assured
himself that he was comparatively uninjured, was
for those who were his fellow-passengers on this
race to ruin and death; and perhaps it is not
strange that the fair young lady who had occupied
the opposite seat in the car came to his mind.
Men and women were disengaging themselves
from the shapeless rubbish. Some wept, some
groaned, and some were motionless and silent.
</p>
<p>He did not see the fair stranger among those
who were struggling back to consciousness. A
portion of the top of the car lay near him, which
he raised up. It rested heavily upon the form of
a maiden, which he at once recognized by the dress
to be that of the gentle stranger. The sight roused
all his energies; and he felt that strength which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
had fired his muscles when he trod the field of
battle. With desperate eagerness, he raised the
heavy fragment which was crowding out the young
life of the tender form, and bore it away, so that
she was released from its cruel pressure.
</p>
<p>She, poor girl! felt it not; for her eyes were
closed, and her marble cheek was stained with
blood. The young officer, tenderly interested in her
fate, bent over her, and raised the inanimate form.
He bore it in his arms to a green spot, away from
the scattered fragments of the train, and laid it
gently down upon the bosom of mother earth. By
all the means within his power, he endeavored to
convince himself that death had not yet invaded the
lovely temple of her being. But still she was silent
and motionless. There was not a sign by which
he could determine the momentous question.
</p>
<p>He was unwilling to believe that the beautiful
stranger was dead. It seemed too hard and cruel
that one so young and fair should be thus rudely
hurried out of existence, without a mother or even
a father near to receive her last gaze on earth,
and listen to the soft sigh with which she breathed
forth her last throb of existence. He had a telescopic
drinking-cup in his pocket, with which he
hastened to a brook that flowed through the valley.
Filling it with water, he returned to his charge.
He sprinkled her face, and rubbed her temples,
and exerted himself to the best of his knowledge
and ability to awaken some signs of life.
</p>
<p>The task seemed hopeless; and he was about to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
abandon it in despair, to render assistance to those
who needed it more than the fair, silent form
before him, when an almost imperceptible sigh
gladdened his heart, and caused him to renew his
exertions. Procuring another cup of water, he
persistently sprinkled the fair face and chafed the
temples of his charge. With his handkerchief
he washed away the blood-stains, and ascertained
that she was only slightly cut just above the ear.
</p>
<p>Cheered by the success which had rewarded his
efforts, he continued to bathe and chafe till the
gentle stranger opened her eyes. In a few moments
more she recovered her consciousness, and
cast a bewildered glance around her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is my father?&#8221; said she; and, as she
spoke, the fearful nature of the catastrophe
dawned upon her mind, and she partially rose from
her recumbent posture.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers could not tell where her
father was, and his first thought was that he must
be beneath the wreck of the shattered cars. For
the first time, he looked about him to measure with
his eye the extent of the calamity. At that moment
he discovered the engine, with the forward part of
the train, backing down the railroad. Only the
two rear cars had been precipitated over the embankment;
the accident having been caused by the
breaking of an axle on the last car but one. The
shackle connecting this with the next one had given
way, and the broken car had darted off the bank,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
carrying the rear one with it, while the rest of the
train dashed on to its destination.
</p>
<p>Of course the calamity was immediately discovered;
but a considerable time elapsed&mdash;as time was
measured by those who were suffering and dying
beneath the <i>débris</i> of the train&mdash;before the engine
could be stopped, and backed to the scene of the
accident. Lieutenant Somers had seen the lady&#8217;s
father go forward, and had heard him say he was
going to the smoking-car; he was therefore satisfied
that he was safe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be here presently,&#8221; he replied to the
anxious question of the fair stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he was&mdash;oh, dear! Perhaps he
was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! he wasn&#8217;t. The smoking-car was not
thrown off the track,&#8221; interposed the young officer,
promptly removing from her mind the terrible fear
which took possession of her first conscious moments.
&#8220;Are you much hurt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I don&#8217;t think I am; but one of
my arms feels very numb.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me examine it,&#8221; continued our traveler,
tenderly raising the injured member.
</p>
<p>He was not deeply skilled in surgery; but he
knew enough of the mysteries of anatomy to discover
that the arm was broken between the elbow
and the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid your arm is broken,&#8221; said he cautiously,
as though he feared the announcement
would cause her to faint again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad it is no worse,&#8221; said she with a
languid smile, and without exhibiting the least indication
of feminine weakness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been worse, certainly. Can I do
anything more for you?&#8221; added Lieutenant
Somers, glancing at the wreck of the cars, with a
feeling that his duty then was a less pleasing one
than that of attending to the wants of the beautiful
stranger; for there were still men and women lying
helpless and unserved in the midst of the ruins.
</p>
<p>The train stopped upon the road; and the passengers,
though appalled by the sight, rushed down
the bank to render willing assistance to the sufferers.
Among them was the father of the young
lady, who leaped frantically down the steep, and
passed from one to another of the forms which the
survivors had taken from the wreck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is your father,&#8221; said Lieutenant Somers
as he recognized him among the excited passengers.
&#8220;I will go and tell him where you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do, if you please,&#8221; replied the lady faintly.
</p>
<p>He ran to the distracted parent, and seized him
by the arm as he dashed from one place to another
in search of the gentle maiden whose life was part
of his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your daughter is out here, sir,&#8221; said Lieutenant
Somers, pointing to the spot where he had
borne her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter!&#8221; gasped the agonized father.
&#8220;Where&mdash;where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this direction, sir.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is she&mdash;O Heaven, spare me!&#8221; groaned he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is hurt, but I think not very badly. Her
left arm is broken, and her head is slightly cut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O God, I thank Thee!&#8221; gasped the father, as
he walked with the lieutenant to the place where
the young lady was sitting on the grass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you need not be alarmed about her,&#8221;
added our officer, anxious to console the suffering
parent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor Emmie!&#8221; exclaimed the anxious
father when they reached the spot, while he knelt
down upon the grass by her side, the tears coursing
in torrents down his pale cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed, father,&#8221; replied she, putting
her uninjured arm around his neck and kissing him,
while their tears mingled. &#8220;I am not much hurt,
father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers had a heart as well as a
strong and willing arm, and he could not restrain
his own tears as he witnessed the touching scene.
The meeting seemed to be so sacred to him, that
he could not stand an idle gazer upon the expression
of that hallowed affection as it flowed from the
warm hearts of the father and daughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As I can be of no further service here, I will
go and do what I can for those who need my help.
If you want any assistance, I shall be close at
hand,&#8221; said he, as he walked away to the busy scene
of woe which surrounded the wreck.
</p>
<p>The wounded, the maimed, and the dead were
rapidly taken from the pile of ruins, and placed in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
the cars on the road; and there was no longer anything
for the young officer to do. He returned to
the grassy couch of her whom he could not but regard
as peculiarly his patient. The father had recovered
his self-possession, and satisfied himself
that Emmie was not more seriously injured than
her deliverer had declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My young friend, while I thank God that my
daughter is still alive, I am very grateful to you
for the care you have bestowed upon her,&#8221; said the
father, as he grasped the young officer&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may well thank him, Mr. Guilford,&#8221; said
one of the two gentlemen who had followed the
young officer to the spot; &#8220;for the first thing I saw,
when I came out from under the ruins, was this
young man lifting half the top of the car off your
daughter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir, but I think we should
convey the young lady up to the cars; for I see they
are about ready to start,&#8221; said Lieutenant Somers,
blushing up to the eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, young man,&#8221; added Mr. Guilford
with deep feeling. &#8220;I must see you again, and
know more about you. Emmie has told me how
kind you have been to her; and you may be sure
I shall never forget it while I live. How do you
feel now, Emmie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My arm begins to pain me a little,&#8221; she answered
languidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must put you into the car, and in a short
time we shall be able to do something for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will carry her up to the train, sir,&#8221; said the
young officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, sir,&#8221; said Emmie with a smile;
&#8220;but I think I can walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the gentleman who had spoken before,
&#8220;I saw him carry you from the wreck to this
place; and I am bound to say, I never saw a mother
handle her baby more tenderly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very grateful to him for what he has done
for me,&#8221; added Emmie with a slight blush; &#8220;and
if I needed his services, I certainly should accept
his kind offer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took the arm of her father, and walked very
well till she came to the steep bank, whose ascent
required more strength than she then possessed.
Her father and Lieutenant Somers then made a
&#8220;hand-chair,&#8221; and bore her up to the car, in which
she was as comfortably disposed as the circumstances
would permit. The train started with its
melancholy freight of wounded, dead and dying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, sir, you are an officer in the army,&#8221; said
Mr. Guilford as the train moved off; &#8220;but I have
not yet learned your name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas Somers, sir,&#8221; replied our young officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must trouble you to write it down for me,
with your residence when at home, and your regiment
in the field.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers complied with this request,
and in return the gentleman gave him his address.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never forget you, Lieutenant Somers,&#8221;
said Mr. Guilford when he had carefully deposited
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the paper in his memorandum-book. &#8220;I have it in
my power to be of service to you; and if you ever
want a friend, I shall consider it a favor if you will
come to me, or write to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir; I am very much obliged to you.
But I hope you won&#8217;t consider yourself under any
obligations to me for what I have done. I couldn&#8217;t
have helped doing it if I had tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, you are in luck,&#8221; said the
gentleman who had accompanied him before.
&#8220;That is Senator Guilford, of &mdash;&mdash;, and he will
make a brigadier-general of you before you are a
year older.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A FRIEND AT COURT</h3>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant Somers sat down in one corner of
the car, near the seats occupied by Miss Guilford
and her father. He was just beginning to be conscious
of the fact that he had done a &#8220;big thing;&#8221;
not because he had helped one of God&#8217;s suffering
creatures, but because she happened to be a Senator&#8217;s
daughter. But he still had the happy reflection,
that what he had done had been prompted
by motives of humanity, not by the love of applause,
or for the purpose of winning the favor of
a great man who could dispense the &#8220;loaves and
fishes&#8221; when he should need them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>He was rather sensitive. He was a young man
of eighteen, and he had not yet become familiar
with the grossness and selfishness of this calculating
world. He was rather offended at the patronage
which the Senator had proposed to bestow
upon him, and he even regretted that he had so
readily given him his address.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers regarded himself as emphatically
a fighting officer; and the idea of working his
way up to distinction by the favor of a member of
Congress was repulsive to him. He really wished
the Hon. Mr. Guilford had only thanked him for
what he had done, and not said a word about having
it in his power to be of service to him.
</p>
<p>While he was meditating upon the events which
had transpired, and the Senator&#8217;s patronizing offer,
he saw Captain de Banyan enter the forward door
of the car through which the gentleman who had
taken so much pains to compliment the young
officer had disappeared a short time before. The
distinguished captain walked through the car
directly to the seat of the lieutenant, who had not
even yet ceased to blush under the praises which
had been bestowed upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, your hand,&#8221; said he, extending his
own. &#8220;I have heard all about it, and am proud
that our regiment has furnished so brave and devoted
a man. Oh, don&#8217;t blush, my dear fellow!
You are a modest man. I sympathize with you;
for I am a modest man myself. I didn&#8217;t get over
blushing for three weeks after his imperial majesty,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
the Emperor of France, complimented me for some
little thing I did at the battle of Palestro.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that was at Magenta,&#8221; added
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it was. The fact is, I have been in a great
many battles, and I get them mixed up a little
sometimes. But you are in luck, Somers,&#8221; continued
the captain in a lower tone, as he seated himself
by the side of his fellow-officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They say she is the daughter of a Senator.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What of that! Why, my dear fellow, you are
as innocent as a school girl. Don&#8217;t you see he can
get you on some general&#8217;s staff, and have you promoted
every time there is a skirmish?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be promoted unless I earn it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t; but every officer that earns
it won&#8217;t get it. By the way, Somers, can&#8217;t you introduce
me to the old gentleman?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw him before in my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter for that. I&#8217;ll warrant you, he&#8217;ll be
glad to make all your friends his friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t feel enough acquainted with him
to introduce a gentleman whom I never saw in
my life till two hours ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, my dear fellow; excuse me,&#8221; replied
Captain de Banyan, looking very much disappointed.
&#8220;I dare say, if I should show him the
autograph of the Emperor of France, he would be
very glad to know me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt of it. At any rate, I recommend you
to make the trial.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but the mischief of it is, I have left all
those papers at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unfortunate,&#8221; added Lieutenant Somers,
who had some serious doubts in regard to the
existence of those papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is. If I had been lucky enough to have
made the acquaintance of that young lady, as you
have, I would not let my aspirations stop short of
the stars of a major-general.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not as it is, if you do your duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! my dear fellow, you are as sentimental as
a girl of sixteen. I am a modest man; but, in my
estimation, there are ten thousand men in the army
as good as I am. They can&#8217;t all be major-generals,
can they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if you live a few months longer, you will
find out how good a thing it is to have a friend at
court. You are a modest young man; but I suppose
you think there isn&#8217;t another man in the army who
is quite your equal, and that your merit and your
bravery will make a brigadier of you in less than a
year. It&#8217;s a good thing to think so; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. That would be modesty with
a vengeance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a sentimental boy like you once, and I
was just as certain that I should be made a field-marshal,
and have the command of the French
army in the Crimea&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were in the English army in the
Crimea,&#8221; interposed the young lieutenant, eager to
change the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, in the English army; that&#8217;s what I
said,&#8221; continued the gallant captain, entirely unmoved
by the interruption. &#8220;I was just as sure
of having the command of the British army in the
Crimea as you are of becoming a brigadier by the
time we get into Richmond. But I have no friends
at court as you have now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of such a thing as being a
brigadier,&#8221; protested Somers. &#8220;I never even expected
to become a second lieutenant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t much to be a brigadier. I served with
&#8216;Old Rosey&#8217; in West Virginia for a time. We had
a captain there who didn&#8217;t know any more about
military than a swine does about Lord Chesterfield&#8217;s
table etiquette. He went into action with
a cane in his hand, hawbucking his company about
just as a farmer does a yoke of cattle. That fellow
is a brigadier-general now; and there&#8217;s hope for
you and me, if we can only have a friend at court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am higher now than I ever expected to be,
and I wouldn&#8217;t give a straw for fifty friends at
court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you are sentimental; but you&#8217;ll
get over that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers,&#8221; said Senator Guilford,
who had risen from his seat, and approached that
occupied by the two officers, &#8220;I shall leave the
train at the next stopping-place, in order to procure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
proper medical attendance for my daughter.
I desire again to express my thanks to you for the
signal service you have rendered to my daughter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our hero blushed again, and stammered out
some deprecatory remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are in Washington, you must call
and see me. You must promise this for Emmie&#8217;s
sake, if not for mine,&#8221; added the Senator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very happy to call,&#8221; replied the
young officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend Lieutenant Somers is as bashful as
a maiden of sweet sixteen,&#8221; interposed Captain de
Banyan. &#8220;I beg your pardon, Mr. Guilford;
though your name and fame are familiar to me, I
have not the honor of your personal acquaintance;
but, under the circumstances, I shall make it part
of my duty to see that my friend does not neglect
your reasonable request.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; replied the Senator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan, at your service,&#8221; added
the modest officer who had served in Italy and the
Crimea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Captain de Banyan. I see you are
in the same regiment with Lieutenant Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I have that honor; and I assure you
there is not a nobler and braver young officer in
the Army of the Potomac. He reminds me very
much of a splendid fellow I served with in the
Crimea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! you were in the Crimea?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, sir; and he looks very much like Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
de Waite, whom I saw made a major on the
field of Magenta, for the most daring bravery, by
the Emperor of France.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen service, captain,&#8221; added the
Senator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must speak with my daughter, lieutenant,
before we part,&#8221; continued Mr. Guilford. &#8220;Her
gratitude has no limit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers was astounded by the
effrontery of his military companion, who had
claimed to be his friend, and forced himself upon
the acquaintance of the powerful man on the
strength of that intimacy; had even brought to his
notice the fact&mdash;if it was a fact&mdash;that he had been
at Magenta and in the Crimea. The simple-minded
young man had seen no such diplomacy in
Pinchbrook, or in the course of his travels in Maryland
and Virginia; and he was fearful that the audacious
fellow would dare to address the daughter
as he had the father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be seated,&#8221; said the Senator, as he pointed to
the seat in front of Miss Emmie.
</p>
<p>She was pale, and appeared to be suffering from
the pain of her broken arm; but she bestowed a
sweet smile upon him as he took the proffered seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, after what I have heard
from Mr. Holman&#8221;&mdash;that was the gentleman who
had spoken so handsomely of him&mdash;&#8220;I feel sure
that I owe my life to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not, Miss Guilford,&#8221; replied the lieutenant,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
very much embarrassed. &#8220;I only pulled
you out from the ruins; I couldn&#8217;t have helped
doing it if I had tried; and I hope you won&#8217;t feel
under any obligations to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do feel under very great obligations to
you, and I assure you I am happy to owe my life
to so brave and gallant a soldier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers felt just as though he was reading an
exciting chapter in a sensational novel; though he
could not help thinking of Lilian Ashford, and thus
spoiling all the romance of the affair. He made no
reply to Miss Emmie&#8217;s pretty speech; it was
utterly impossible for him to do so; and therein he
differed from all the heroes of the novels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to hear from you some time, and even
to see you again. You must promise to call and see
me when we get to Washington.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may not be able to leave my regiment at that
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! my father will get you a furlough any time
you want one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers thought he would like to see
himself asking a furlough to enable him to visit
a young lady in Washington, even if she was a
Senator&#8217;s daughter; but he promised to call at Mr.
Guilford&#8217;s whenever he happened to be at the
capital, which was entirely satisfactory to the young
lady. Though Emmie was by this time suffering
severely, she managed to say several pleasant
things; and among them she hinted that her father
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
could make a brigadier as easily as a tinker could
make a tin kettle.
</p>
<p>The train arrived at the stopping-place; and Mr.
Guilford, with the assistance of Lieutenant Somers,
placed his daughter in a carriage. Captain de
Banyan was very anxious to assist in the operation;
but the sufferer declined. They parted with
a renewed promise on the part of the young officer
to visit her in Washington, whenever his duty
called him to that city. The cars arrived in New
York two hours behind time&mdash;too late to connect
with the train for Philadelphia. Captain de Banyan
proposed, as they were obliged to remain in
the city over night, that they should stop at the
&#8220;Fifth Avenue,&#8221; declaring that it was the best
hotel in New York. Somers objected; hoping that
he should thus escape the society of the captain,
who appeared to be altogether too &#8220;fast&#8221; for his
time.
</p>
<p>De Banyan was accommodating; and, when the
lieutenant mentioned a small hotel downtown, he
readily agreed to the proposition, and Somers
found it useless to attempt to get rid of him. The
captain, for some reason or other, appeared to have
taken a decided liking to our officer. Perhaps he
hoped to share with him the powerful patronage
of Senator Guilford.
</p>
<p>After supper, Captain de Banyan proposed that
they should go out and see the &#8220;elephant;&#8221; but
Somers, having no taste for the study of this description
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
of natural history, positively declined to
see the metaphorical monster.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go somewhere,&#8221; persisted the captain,
taking up a newspaper. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a &#8216;Lecture on
the Battle of Bull Run, by Lieutenant-Colonel
Staggerback, who participated in that memorable
action,&#8217;&#8221; he continued, reading from the paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in that battle myself; I don&#8217;t object to
that,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Then we&#8217;ll go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked up Broadway till they came to one
of those gaudy saloons where rum and ruin are
tricked out in the gayest of colors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are early for the lecture, Somers. Let&#8217;s go
in here, and see what there is to be seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I thank you; I don&#8217;t care about going into
any of these dens of vice and sin.&#8221;
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>As, to be hated, needs but to be seen,&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>repeated the captain with dramatic force.
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;But seen too oft&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>You needn&#8217;t see it but once. Don&#8217;t you want to
see the lions of the metropolis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t object to the lions; but, in my opinion,
you will find only the donkeys in there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see, at any rate.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will go in for a moment,&#8221; replied Somers,
who did not like to seem over-squeamish.
</p>
<p>They entered this outer gate to ruin. There was
a bar at the end next to the street, while at the
other end a band of music was playing the national
airs. It looked like a very pleasant place to the
young lieutenant, who had never entered one of
these saloons before.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE FIRE OF TEMPTATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Captain de Banyan sauntered gracefully up
the saloon, with Somers at his side. He appeared
to be perfectly at home, and to have all the ease
and finish of a thorough man of the world. His
movements were calculated to make a sensation;
and, as he passed along, old topers and gay young
bloods paused to glance at him. If the captain had
been in command of the Army of the Potomac, his
elevated position would hardly have justified a
more extensive flourish than he made.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers was duly impressed by the
magnificence of his companion, though the surroundings
of the place created some painful misgivings
in his mind. The captain sat down at one
of the little tables where the frequenters of the
saloon who were disposed to prolong the enjoyment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
of their drams discussed &#8220;juleps,&#8221; &#8220;cobblers,&#8221; and
other villainous compounds.
</p>
<p>Somers could not do less than seat himself at the
other side of the table. He was ill at ease, even
while he was endeavoring to seem indifferent and
at home. I am sorry to say he was haunted by
that abominable bugbear which often takes possession
of the minds of young men when they find
themselves in the presence of those who are adepts
in the arts of vice&mdash;a fear of being thought
&#8220;green,&#8221; &#8220;verdant,&#8221; or being measured by some
other adjective used in fast circles to caricature the
innocence of a soul unsullied by contact with the
vices and follies of the city. He half expected that
some of the dissolute young wretches who were
drinking, swearing, and pouring the filth of a
poisoned mind from their lips, would ask him if
&#8220;his mother knew he was out.&#8221; He tried to maintain
his self-possession, and to seem at home where
ruin was rioting in the souls of young men. If he
did not entirely succeed, it was all the more to his
credit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you take?&#8221; demanded Captain de
Banyan, after they had sat at the table long enough
to examine the prominent features of the saloon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a walk,&#8221; replied Lieutenant Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! What will you drink?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, thank you. I&#8217;ve just been to supper,
and don&#8217;t want anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but people who come in here, and listen
to the music, are expected to patronize the establishment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
I&#8217;m going to have a brandy smash:
shall I order one for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t drink alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never drink.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! A lieutenant in our regiment, and
not drink! I see! You haven&#8217;t learned yet; but
it won&#8217;t take you long. Your case is exactly my
own. I was about your age when I went to the
Crimea, and didn&#8217;t know wine from brandy. After
the battle of Balaclava, where I did some little
thing which excited the admiration of the nobs in
command, Lord Raglan sent for me, and invited
me to take a glass of wine with him. Of course,
I could not refuse his lordship, especially as he was
in the very act of complimenting me for what he
was pleased to call my gallant conduct. I drank
my first glass of wine then. It was Sicily Madeira,
and light, sweet wine; and, my dear fellow, you
shall begin with the same, and we will drink the
health of Senator Guilford and his fair daughter.
Waiter, one brandy smash and one Sicily Madeira.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Captain de Banyan, you must excuse
me,&#8221; stammered Somers, completely bewildered by
the eloquent and insinuating manners of his brilliant
companion, who had spoken loud enough to
attract the attention of a dozen idlers greedy for
excitement of any kind, and to whom the latter
part of his remarks seemed to be addressed, rather
than to the timid young man in front of him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>Captain de Banyan appeared to have a point to
carry; which was nothing less than to overcome
the conscientious scruples of the young officer. He
had spoken loud enough to attract the attention of
these miserable tipplers, that Somers might be
over-awed by their presence, and intimidated by
their sneers, and thus compelled to taste the intoxicating
cup. The squad of fast men who had
taken positions near the table were interested in
the scene, and impatient to see the pure soul
tumbled from its lofty eminence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the nectar!&#8221; almost shouted the captain
as the waiter placed the drinks upon the table.
&#8220;Wine for you; brandy for me. You will be promoted
to brandy one of these days, my boy, when
your head is stronger and your nerves stiffer.
Lieutenant Somers, here&#8217;s to the health of the
patriot statesman, Senator Guilford, and his lovely
daughter;&#8221; and the captain pushed aside the straw
in the vile compound, and raised the glass to his
lips.
</p>
<p>Somers was embarrassed at his position, and bewildered
by the dashing speeches of his companion.
A dozen pair of leering eyes were fixed upon him;
a dozen mouths were wrinkled into sottish smiles,
called up by his sufferings at that critical moment.
He reached forth his hand, and grasped the slender
stem of the wine-glass; but his arm trembled more
than that of the most hardened toper in the group
before him. He had been trembling in the presence
of that squad of tyrants&mdash;those leer-eyed grinning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
debauchees, who seemed to be opening the
gate of hell, and bidding him enter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Somers,&#8221; said the still small voice which
had spoken to him a thousand times before in the
perils and temptations through which he had
passed, &#8220;you have behaved yourself very well thus
far. You have been promoted for bravery on the
battlefield; and now will you cower in the presence
of this brilliant brawler, and these weak-minded,
cowardly tipplers? What would your
mother say if she could see you now, with your
shaking hand fastened to the wine-cup? What
would Lilian Ashford say? Dare you drink the
health of Emmie Guilford in such a place as this?
You should have smote the lips that mentioned
her name in such a presence!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew back his hand from the glass. His
muscles tightened up, as they had on the bloody
field of Williamsburg. Tom Somers was himself
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Somers, you don&#8217;t drink,&#8221; added the
captain sarcastically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I thank you; I never drink,&#8221; he answered
resolutely, as he cast a steady glance of pity and
contempt at the bloated crew who had been reveling
in his embarrassment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t refuse now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most decidedly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, I took you for a young man
of pluck. I&#8217;m disappointed. You will pardon me,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
my dear fellow; but I can&#8217;t help regarding your
conduct as rather shabby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never drink, as I have said before, and I do
not intend to begin now. If I have been shabby, I
hope you will excuse me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I will excuse you, when you atone for
your folly, and drink with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The spectators laughed, and evidently thought
the captain had made a point.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I can never atone for my folly, as you
call it,&#8221; replied Somers, his courage increasing as
the trial demanded it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would Lord Raglan have said if I had
refused to drink his Sicily Madeira?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely he would have said just what you
said; but there would have been no more sense in
it then than now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for young &#8217;un!&#8221; said a seedy dandy,
whose love of fancy drinks had made a compromise
with his love of dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will leave it to these gentlemen to decide
whether I have not spoken reason and good sense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will leave you and these <i>gentlemen</i> to settle
that question to suit yourselves, and I will bid you
good-evening,&#8221; said Somers, rising from his chair.
</p>
<p>The unpleasant emphasis which he placed upon
the word &#8220;gentlemen&#8221; created a decided sensation
among the group of idlers; and, as he stepped
from behind the table, he was confronted by a
young man with bloodshot eyes and bloated cheeks,
but dressed in the extreme of fashion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, you wear the colors of the United States
Army,&#8221; said the juvenile tippler; &#8220;but you can&#8217;t
be permitted to insult a gentleman with impunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers wanted to laugh in the face
of this specimen of bar-room chivalry, for he forcibly
reminded him of a belligerent little bantam-rooster
that paraded the barnyard of his mother&#8217;s
cottage at Pinchbrook; but he was prudent enough
not to give any further cause of offense. Bestowing
one glance at this champion of the tippler&#8217;s
coterie, he turned aside, and attempted to move
towards the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, sir,&#8221; continued the young man, who
plainly wanted to make a little capital out of a
fight, in defense of the dignity of his friends.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t go without an apology, or&mdash;or a fight,&#8221;
added the bully, shaking his head significantly, as
he placed himself in front of the young lieutenant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I to apologize for?&#8221; asked Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You insulted the whole party of us. You intimated
that we were no gentlemen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t spoken to any of you since I came
in,&#8221; protested Somers. &#8220;I never had anything to
do with you, and I don&#8217;t know whether you are
gentlemen or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear that, gentlemen!&#8221; added the bully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have said all that is necessary to say;
with your leave I will go,&#8221; said Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, sir!&#8221; snarled the young ruffian, putting
his hand on the lieutenant&#8217;s collar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your hand off!&#8221; said he sternly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>The fellow complied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This thing has gone far enough, sir,&#8221; said Captain
de Banyan, stepping between Somers and his
assailant. &#8220;Lieutenant Somers is my friend; and,
if you put the weight of your little finger upon him,
I&#8217;ll annihilate you quicker than I did a certain
Austrian field-marshal at the battle of Solferino.
Gentlemen, permit me to apologize for my inexperienced
friend if he has uttered any indiscreet
word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must apologize!&#8221; blustered the young ruffian.
&#8220;He says we are no gentlemen. Let him
prove it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have proved it yourself, you little ape,&#8221;
replied the captain, as he stepped up to the bar, and
paid his reckoning, bestowing no more attention
upon the ruffled little bully than if he had been a
very small puppy; which perhaps he was not, by
a strict construction of terms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I demand satisfaction!&#8221; roared the flashy little
toper. &#8220;Apologize, or fight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither, my gay and festive lark,&#8221; said the
captain with abundant good humor, as he took
Somers&#8217;s arm, and sauntered leisurely towards the
door. &#8220;Now, my dear fellow, we will go and hear
what Lieutenant-Colonel Staggerback has to say
about the battle of Bull Run. I was in that action,
and rallied the Fire Zouaves when Colonel Ellsworth
was killed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Ellsworth! He wasn&#8217;t killed at Bull
Run!&#8221; exclaimed Somers, astonished beyond measure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
at the singular character which his companion
was developing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right; he was killed at Ball&#8217;s Bluff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not; but were you at Bull Run?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I was. I was on General Frémont&#8217;s
staff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you, indeed? Whew!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What may be the precise meaning of that
whistle? Do you think I was not there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t remember to have seen you
there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely you did not; but you will call to
mind the fact, that things were rather mixed up in
that action. But never mind that: we will talk
those things over when we get down upon the
Peninsula, and have nothing else to think about.
Do you really mean to say, my dear fellow, that
you never drink at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have heard of a man climbing up to the
moon on a greased rainbow; but I never heard of
an officer before that didn&#8217;t drink.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you haven&#8217;t been very careful in the
choice of your companions. I know a great many
that never taste liquor under any circumstances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be so; and I am willing to confess that
I have found one. I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it before
if I had read it in the Constitution of the
United States. I owe you an apology, then, for
letting on in that saloon. I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
your feelings, my dear fellow; but I thought you
were joking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will not repeat the experiment, then;
though I shall consider myself fair game if I ever
enter another rum-shop,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>They proceeded to the place designated for the
lecture; and Captain de Banyan betrayed his interest
in that memorable battle, where he had served
on the staff of General Frémont, by going to sleep
before the eloquent &#8220;participant&#8221; had got half-way
through the exordium. Lieutenant Somers
listened attentively until he was satisfied that Colonel
Staggerback either was not in the battle, or that
he had escorted &#8220;Bull Run Russell&#8221; off the field.
</p>
<p>When the lecture was finished, Somers awakened
his edified companion, and they returned to the
hotel; though the captain hinted several times on
the way that the &#8220;elephant&#8221; could be seen to better
advantage in New York than in any other city in
the Union. The young lieutenant had an utter
disgust for the elephant, and took no hints. Before
he retired that night, he thanked God, more earnestly
and devoutly than usual, that he had been
enabled to pass unscathed through the fires of
temptation. He was still in condition to look his
mother in the face.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ON THE SKIRMISH LINE</h3>
</div>

<p>In the morning our travelers resumed their
journey, more refreshed and in better condition
for service than if they had spent the evening in
chasing the &#8220;elephant&#8221; from one to another of the
gilded dens of dissipation with which the metropolis
abounds. In spite of his errors and sins, Somers
could not help liking his dashing companion. He
was a dangerous person; but his enthusiasm was so
captivating, that he could not close his heart
against him. But, while he liked the captain, he
hated his vices.
</p>
<p>They stopped in Philadelphia only long enough
to dine, and in Baltimore only long enough for supper;
arriving at Washington in the evening. Captain
de Banyan again proposed to &#8220;go round;&#8221;
which, rendered into unmistakable English, meant
to visit the drinking-houses and gambling-saloons
of the city, to say nothing of worse places. Lieutenant
Somers had grown wise by experience; and
no amount of persuasion could induce him to leave
the hotel. It was horrible to him to think of spending
even his leisure time in the haunts of dissipation,
when his country was bleeding from a thousand
wounds; when his gallant comrades in the
Army of the Potomac were enduring peril and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
hardship in front of the enemy. He had no taste
for carousing at any time, and every fiber of his
moral nature was firmly set against the vices which
lured on his reckless companion.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers stayed at the hotel that evening,
listening to the conversation of the officers
who had been at the front within a few days. The
great battle of Fair Oaks had been fought during
his absence, and there was every prospect that the
most tremendous operations of the war would soon
commence. He listened with the deepest interest
to the accounts from the army, and needed none of
the stimulus of the bar-room or the gambling-saloon
to furnish him with excitement. He was
soon to be an actor in the momentous events of the
campaign; and the thought was full of inspiration,
and lifted him up from the gross and vulgar tastes
of his companion.
</p>
<p>Before noon the next day, somewhat against the
inclination of Captain de Banyan, the two officers
were on board a steamer bound down the river.
After some delays, they arrived at White House,
on the Pamunkey River; and then proceeded by
railroad nearly to the camp of the regiment,
at Poplar Hill, in the very depths of White Oak
Swamp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My blessed boy!&#8221; shouted Sergeant Hapgood
when Lieutenant Somers appeared in the camp.
</p>
<p>The veteran rushed upon him, and, not content
to shake his hand he proceeded to hug him in the
most extraordinary manner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you, Hapgood! How have
you been since I left?&#8221; said Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;First-rate! Bless my withered old carcass,
Tom, but I thought I never should see you again.
Why, Tom, how handsome you&#8217;ve grown! Well,
you&#8217;ll be a brigadier one of these days, and there
won&#8217;t be a better-looking officer on the field. Dear
me, Tom&mdash;&mdash; Beg pardon; I forgot that you are
an officer; and I mustn&#8217;t call you Tom any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that, uncle,&#8221; added Somers, laughing.
&#8220;It would hardly be good discipline for a
sergeant to call an officer by a nickname; but we
will compromise, and you shall call me Tom when
we are not on duty, and there is no one within
hearing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Compromise! Don&#8217;t never use that word to
me. After we fit the battle of Bull Run, I gouged
that word out of my dictionary. No, sir! You are
a leftenant now; and I shall allus call you Leftenant
Somers, even if there ain&#8217;t nobody within ten
mile of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you please, uncle; but, whatever you call
me, we shall be just as good friends as we ever
were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, Leftenant Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely, Sergeant Hapgood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what&#8217;s the news in Pinchbrook?&#8221; asked
the veteran.
</p>
<p>But, before Somers had a chance to tell the news
from home, he was welcomed to the camp, and
cheered, by officers and men; and his account of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
what had transpired in Pinchbrook during his
thirty days&#8217; furlough was eagerly listened to by
a large and attentive audience. He received in return
a full history of the regiment during his absence.
Though the narrative of sundry exciting
events, such as forays upon pig-sties, poultry-yards,
and kitchen-gardens, was highly amusing,
there was a tale of sadness to tell&mdash;of deaths by
disease and on the battlefield.
</p>
<p>Many cheerful hearts that were beating with life
and hope a few weeks before, were now silent in
the grave&mdash;the soldier&#8217;s mausoleum in a strange
land. But soldiers have no time to weep over a
dead past; they must live in the hope of a glorious
future; and when they had dropped a tear to the
memory of the noble and the true who had fallen
on the field or died in the hospital, victims of the
pestilential airs of the swamp, they laughed as
merrily as ever, careless of Death&#8217;s poised arrows
which were always aimed at them.
</p>
<p>Captain de Banyan took his place in the regiment,
where Somers found that he was prodigiously
popular, even after a few hours&#8217; acquaintance
with his new command; but who he was, where he
came from, and how he had procured his commission,
was a mystery to officers and men. He told
tremendous stories about the Crimea and the
Italian war; and now for the first time intimated
that he was the only survivor of the company which
led the advance at the storming of Chapultepec, in
the Mexican war. However much the officers enjoyed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
his stories, it is not probable that all of them
believed what they heard.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers was perfectly familiar with
the company and battalion drill; and, having quick
perception and abundant self-possession, he was
competent at once to perform his duties as an
officer. He had no vices to be criticized by the
men, who respected him not only for his bravery
on the battlefield, but for his good moral character;
for even the vicious respect the virtues which they
practically contemn. Being neither arbitrary nor
tyrannical, he was cheerfully obeyed; and his company
never appeared better than when, by the
temporary absence of his superior, it was under
his command.
</p>
<p>He was, however, allowed but a short time to
become acquainted with the routine of the new
duty before he was summoned to participate in
those tremendous events which have passed into
history as at once the most brilliant and disastrous
operations of the war; brilliant in that our gallant
army was almost invariably victorious, disastrous
in that they were the forerunners of the ultimate
failure of a hopeful campaign. The victory at
Fair Oaks had raised the hopes of that brave,
thinking army.
</p>
<p>The picket-lines were within a few miles of Richmond,
and the soldiers were burning with enthusiasm
to be led against the enemy in front of them.
They were ready to lay down their lives on the
altar of their bleeding country, if the survivors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
could grasp the boon of peace within the buttressed
walls of the rebel capital&mdash;peace that would hurl
to the ground the defiant traitors, and insure the
safety and perpetuity of free institutions. The
notes of victory, those thinking soldiers believed,
would reverberate through the coming ages, and
point an epoch from which America would date
her grandest and most sublime triumphs.
</p>
<p>But not then was the great rebellion to be overthrown;
for not yet had the leaven of Liberty
leavened the whole lump; not yet had the purposes
of a mysterious Providence been accomplished; and
the brave men who sighed for victory and peace in
the swamps of the Chickahominy were doomed
to years of blood and toil, of victory and defeat, as
they marched on, alike through both, to the consummation
of a nation&#8217;s glorious triumph, not over
paltry armies of arrogant traitors, but over the
incarnation of Evil, over Heaven-defying institutions,
whose downfall established forever principles
as eternal as God Himself.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers was filled with the spirit of
the army. He felt that the salvation of his country
depended upon the valor of that army; and, impressed
with the magnitude of the interests at
stake, he was resolved to do his whole duty. With
cheerful alacrity he obeyed the summons which
brought Grover&#8217;s brigade into line of battle on the
morning of the eventful 25th of June. What was
to be accomplished was not for him to know; but
forward moved the line through the swamp,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
through the woods, through the pools of stagnant
waters up to the hips of the soldiers.
</p>
<p>Impressed by the responsibility of his position,
Lieutenant Somers encouraged the weak as they
struggled through the mire on their trying march,
and with fit words stimulated the enthusiasm of
all. After a march of about a mile, a heavy skirmish
line was thrown out, which soon confronted
that of the rebels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Somers, my dear fellow, the concert is
about to open,&#8221; said Captain de Banyan. &#8220;By the
way, my boy, this reminds me of Magenta,
where&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, confound Magenta!&#8221; exclaimed Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, my dear fellow, you are as petulant as
a belle that has lost her beau.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t propose to tell us a story about
Magenta at such a time as this, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I confess I have a weakness in that direction.
Magenta was a great battle. But I&#8217;m afraid
you are a little nervous,&#8221; laughed the captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nervous? Do you think I&#8217;m a coward?&#8221; demanded
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are not; but you might be a little
nervous for all that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that instant, the sharp crack of a single rifle
was heard, and Somers observed a slight jerk in the
brim of the captain&#8217;s felt hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; exclaimed Captain de Banyan as he
took off his hat, and pointed to a hole through
which the rifle-ball had sped its way. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
month&#8217;s pay that fellow couldn&#8217;t do that again
without making a hole through my head. But
that&#8217;s a singular coincidence. That&#8217;s precisely the
place where the first bullet went through my hat at
Solferino. At Magenta&mdash;ah! I see him,&#8221; added
the captain, as he took a musket from the hands of
one of his men. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet another month&#8217;s pay that
reb has fired his last shot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke, he raised the gun to his shoulder,
and fired up into one of the trees. A crashing of
boughs, a rattling of leaves followed; and a heavy
body was heard to strike the ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You owe me a month&#8217;s pay, Somers,&#8221; continued
Captain de Banyan, as he handed the musket
back to the soldier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; replied the lieutenant, trying to
be as cool as his companion. &#8220;I never bet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. I forgot that you were an exceedingly
proper young man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The skirmish-line, which had paused a moment
for an observation to be taken, now moved forward
again. The rebel skirmishers were discovered, and
the order was given to fire at will. The enemy&#8217;s
sharpshooters were posted in the trees, and they
began to pour in a galling fire upon a portion of
the line.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, my men!&#8221; said Somers, when the firing
commenced. &#8220;Gunpowder&#8217;s expensive; don&#8217;t waste
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a single grain of it, Leftenant Somers,&#8221;
added Sergeant Hapgood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There, uncle!&mdash;up in that tree!&#8221; said Somers,
pointing to a grayback, who was loading his rifle,
about twenty feet from the ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see him!&#8221; replied the sergeant as he leveled
his piece, and fired.
</p>
<p>The rebel was wounded, but he did not come
down; and the captain of the company ordered his
men to move forward. From the thunder of the
artillery and the rattle of musketry, it was evident
that heavy work was in progress on the right and
left.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward, men!&#8221; said Somers, repeating the
order of Captain Benson.
</p>
<p>The men were scattered along an irregular line,
and firing into the bushes, which partially concealed
the rebel skirmishers. Somers&#8217;s platoon advanced
a little more rapidly than the rest of the
line, being favored with a few rods of dry ground.
He had urged them forward for the purpose of dislodging
three sharpshooters perched in a large tree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down, rebs!&#8221; shouted Somers, as he
reached the foot of the tree, and told half a dozen
of his men to point their guns towards them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye say, Yank?&#8221; demanded one of
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come down head first, or feet first?
Take your choice quick!&#8221; replied the lieutenant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you seem to be in arnest, we&#8217;ll come down
the nateral way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did come down without a more pressing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
invitation, and were disarmed, ready to be sent to
the rear.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE REBEL SHARPSHOOTERS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, I don&#8217;t think I can
stand it much longer,&#8221; said Phineas Deane, a
private, who had joined the regiment a few days
before the battle, as he saluted his officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stand what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact on&#8217;t is, lieutenant, I&#8217;m sick. I haven&#8217;t
felt well for two or three days. I come out here to
fight for my country, and I want to do some good.
I might help take them prisoners back, if you say
so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick, are you? What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a bad pain in the bowels,&#8221; replied
Phineas, as he placed himself on the right side of
a tree, and glanced uneasily in the direction of the
rebel skirmish line. &#8220;I&#8217;m subject to sich turns,
but allus git over &#8217;em if I have a chance to lay
down for a few hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you can lie down here!&#8221; added
Somers, who understood the case pretty well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! down here in the mud and water? Wal,
that would be rather steep for a sick man,&#8221; said
Phineas, with a ghastly smile, as he glanced again
towards the enemy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will get some medicine for you. Here,
uncle, let me have one of your powders,&#8221; continued
the lieutenant, addressing old Hapgood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartin; they&#8217;ve done me heaps of good, and
I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re just the thing for that man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers took one of the powders, and opened the
paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my man, open your mouth, and let me
give you this medicine,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of medicine is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll make you kinder sick to the stomach; but
it&#8217;ll cure you in less&#8217;n half an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, lieutenant, I don&#8217;t know as I want to
take any medicine,&#8221; answered poor Phineas, who
was not prepared for this active treatment; though
he would have taken it quick enough if he could be
sent to the rear. &#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t keer about takin&#8217;
on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t, if you don&#8217;t want to get well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only want to go back to camp, and lay down
for a spell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t spare you just yet, Phineas; but, if
you don&#8217;t stir yourself, you will lie down here somewhere,
and never get up again,&#8221; added Somers, as
a shower of bullets passed over their heads. &#8220;Forward,
boys!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The captain detailed a couple of men to conduct
the prisoners to the rear, and the company pressed
forward. The rebel sharpshooters were dislodged
from the trees; a few prisoners were captured; but
the heavy fighting and the heavy losses fell upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
other portions of the line. The rebels had been
forced back, and the movement seemed to be a
success. Half the regiment moved out of the
woods, while the rest remained under the trees;
when a halt was ordered. Somers found himself
near an old house, behind which a number of rebel
sharpshooters had concealed themselves for the
purpose of picking off the Union soldiers.
</p>
<p>The firing in the immediate vicinity had diminished,
though the din of battle resounded on both
sides. The boys were rather nervous, as men are
when standing idle under fire; but it was the nervousness
of restrained enthusiasm, not of fear,
unless it was in the case of invalid Phineas, and a
very few others whose physical health had not been
completely established.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Somers, my dear boy, how do you get
on?&#8221; asked Captain de Banyan, as he sauntered
leisurely up to the lieutenant, whose command
stood next to his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;First-rate; only I should like to have something
a little more active than standing here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes considerable experience to enable a
man to stand still under fire. When I was at the
battle of Alma, I learned that lesson to a charm.
We stood up for forty-two hours under a fierce fire
of grape and canister, to say nothing of musketry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty-two hours!&#8221; exclaimed Somers. &#8220;I
should think you would all have been killed off before
that time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In our regiment, only one man was killed; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
he got asleep, and walked in his dreams over towards
the enemy&#8217;s line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, you can tell a bigger story than any
other man in the army,&#8221; said Somers, laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I have seen more of the world.
When you have been about as much as I have, you
will know more about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very happy to be more actively employed
just now; but I am very well contented
where I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The position they occupied enabled the two
officers to see some sharp fighting along the line.
Through an opening at the right, they saw a rebel
regiment, wearing white jackets, or else stripped
to their shirts, march at double-quick, in splendid
order, with arms at &#8220;right shoulder shift,&#8221; to the
scene of action. It was probably some volunteer
body from Richmond, whom the ladies of the rebel
capital had just dismissed, with sweet benedictions,
to sweep the &#8220;foul Yankees&#8221; from the face of the
earth. They were certainly a splendid body of
men; and the ladies might well be proud of them.
They went into the field in good style, with the
blessings of the fair still lingering fondly in their
ears. But one volley from the veterans of the
Army of the Potomac was enough for them, and
they gave way, running off the field in wild disorder,
threading their way in terror through the
bushes, every man for himself. It is not likely that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
they were welcomed back from the gory field by
the frothy feminine rebels of Richmond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the way the Russians ran at
Palestro!&#8221; exclaimed Captain de Banyan, as he
watched the exciting scene.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Russians at Palestro!&#8221; added Somers,
&#8220;I think you have got things a little mixed, captain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before this difficult question could be settled,
Captain de Banyan was ordered to take a sufficient
force, and drive out the rebels who were skulking
behind the old house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, you shall go with me,&#8221; said he, when
he had received his orders from the colonel.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll do a big thing, if there is any chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready for anything, big or little, captain,&#8221;
replied Somers heartily. &#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;March your men over by that little knoll, and
come round on the other side of the house; I will
move up in another direction, and we will bag the
whole squad. But mind you, Somers, the enemy
are round that way; don&#8217;t let them gobble you up
or lay you out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do the best I can, captain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Angels could do no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lieutenant advanced, with the men detailed
for the purpose, towards the hillock. By taking
a circuitous route, he avoided the observation of
the rebels behind the house, and reached the other
side of the knoll, where, behind the friendly shelter
of a clump of bushes, he was enabled to survey the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
ground. Not more than a quarter of a mile distant
he discovered the rebel breastworks. It was
about the same distance to the house.
</p>
<p>Between the knoll and the house there was a
small patch of wheat, which, by some chance, had
escaped the havoc of foraging parties. Though the
grain was not full-grown, it would afford concealment
to his men. In order to reach it, he must expose
his men to a volley from the rifle-pits, or from
any body of rebels which might be posted in the
vicinity. He could not afford to lose a single man,
and he was perplexed to determine how he should
overcome the distance between the wheat-field and
the knoll.
</p>
<p>It seemed to him very singular that he had not
already been fired upon; and he concluded that it
was because his party had been mistaken for rebels,
or because some of their troops were between him
and the Union lines. Whether the enemy had been
deceived or not, he was fully determined to afford
them no further information in regard to his politics,
if any of them had seen him. He therefore
ordered his men to take off their coats, which some
of them had done before they started on the expedition.
The blue trousers could not be so easily disposed
of; but as some of the boys had straw hats,
some felt, and some caps, it would have been hard
to determine what they were at the distance of a
quarter of a mile, especially as some of the Confederates
wore the plundered clothing of the Union
army.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>After instructing his force in regard to their
future conduct, he marched them boldly into the
open space. To assist the deception, he directed
one of his men to halt occasionally, and point his
musket in the direction of the Union pickets. Not
a shot was fired at them; and when the young
lieutenant reached the wheat-field he fancied that
he was clever enough for any brigadier in the rebel
army.
</p>
<p>It was desirable that the rebel sharpshooters at
the house should not be alarmed; and, when his
men reached the grain, Somers ordered them to get
down upon their hands and knees, and creep cautiously
towards the point to be assailed. The lieutenant,
like a good officer, led the way himself, and
had advanced about half the distance to be accomplished,
when he heard a rustling noise in the
grain before him. It was an ominous sound, and
he paused to take an observation. He could not
see anything without standing up; and, as he was
within twenty rods of the house, it was necessary
to avoid exposing himself.
</p>
<p>From whatever source the sounds proceeded, it
was just as safe to advance as it was to retreat; and
he decided to go forward. With the utmost caution,
he continued to creep along through the
wheat; but he was careful to assure himself that
his men&#8217;s muskets and his own revolver were in
condition for instant use. After he had gone a few
rods farther, the sounds were more apparent; and,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
with no little consternation, he heard voices, rich
with an unmistakable Southern accent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, more of our fellers is coming
through the grain. You mought hear &#8217;em, ef you
weren&#8217;t deafer&#8217;n a dead nigger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heerd &#8217;em. You kin bet yer life they&#8217;re some
of our pickets. Howsomever, I&#8217;m gwine to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, my men! don&#8217;t speak a word!&#8221; whispered
the young lieutenant. &#8220;Lie flat on the
ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rebels were nearer than he had supposed;
for, as he turned from his men, he discovered a
wiry grayback, with the chevrons of a sergeant on
his arms, trying to stare him out of countenance.
The fellow did not look wholesome; and Somers
was in doubt whether to blow his brains out, or let
things take their natural course.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who mought you be?&#8221; demanded the grayback,
exhibiting more curiosity than of fear in his
dirty face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the people,&#8221; replied Somers, disposed
to avoid a direct issue. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m one of the people too,&#8221; grinned the rebel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are; and I suppose you belong to the
army, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet your life I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you won&#8217;t object to telling me which
army you belong to, as there may be some difference
of opinion between us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use to ask a officer dressed in blue,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
and lookin&#8217; as spruce as you be, whar he kim from.
I say, Yank, what are you uns doin&#8217; in hyar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only taking a look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as civil as a Mobile dancin&#8217;-master; and
I axes yer, very perlite, to surrender.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men have you got, reb?&#8221; demanded
the lieutenant, as he put his hand on his revolver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See hyar, Yank; play fair. You uns allers
cheat playin&#8217; poker. Don&#8217;t tech yer shooter yet,&#8221;
replied the grayback coolly, as he thrust the muzzle
of his gun in the lieutenant&#8217;s face. &#8220;Two kin play
at that game, and your wife or mine will be a lone
widder quicker&#8217;n a coon kin wink at the moon.
I&#8217;ve got seven men,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have twenty-three,&#8221; said Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then yer kin whip us if yer be Yanks; for three
of you uns can just lick one of we uns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good logic. Will you surrender, or
fight?&#8221; demanded Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me count your men. I surrender,&#8221; he continued,
after he had stood up, and counted the
Union soldiers. &#8220;Here&#8217;s my shooter; fair play,
even with Yanks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leaving a guard of eight men with his prisoners
when they were disarmed, Somers hastened forward
to complete his mission.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>AN EXPEDITION IN FRONT</h3>
</div>

<p>The affair in the wheat-field had been conducted
very quietly, and apparently had not attracted the
attention of any of the rebels in the vicinity. During
the brief parley, the thunder of the battle had
sounded on the right and left of the parties. The
enemy were in force in their works, and it was believed
that there were squads of pickets in every
place of concealment which the ground afforded.
</p>
<p>Somers was very much surprised to find that he
was not molested, and made all possible haste to
carry out the programme with which he had been
intrusted by Captain de Banyan. Followed by the
balance of his men, he crept carefully towards the
house till he had reached the end of the grain-field.
He could see about a dozen rebels skulking behind
the building, all of them so intent upon getting a
shot at the Union soldiers, that they paid no attention
to the events transpiring in the rear of them;
probably deeming it impossible for an enemy to
approach in that direction.
</p>
<p>The lieutenant had but fifteen men left to execute
his part of the scheme, and there seemed to
be double that number of graybacks lurking in and
about the house. Everything depended upon his
effecting the requisite junction with the force of
the captain. As his superior had but a short distance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
to march, it was probable that he was already
in position to support him; and he decided to make
the attack without permitting any delay to rob him
of the chances of success.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, double-quick, forward!&#8221; shouted Somers,
as he rose from the ground, and led the way to a
position where he could intercept the retreat of the
rebels.
</p>
<p>Agreeably to the instructions previously given,
his men stretched out into an extended line, and
commenced firing at will upon the luckless graybacks
who were in sight. It did not take them long
to find out that they were assailed by a fire in the
rear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surrender!&#8221; shouted Captain de Banyan, who
at this moment appeared at the head of his men.
</p>
<p>The rebels were not disposed to accept this polite
invitation, but began to fall back from the house
in good order. They discharged their pieces at
the force in front, and then started at a run to
effect their escape in the opposite direction. They
forgot for the moment that they had been fired
upon from the rear, or else thought that the fire
had been directed by some of their own people at
the Yankees who had so suddenly attacked in front.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surrender!&#8221; shouted Lieutenant Somers, as
the retreating rebels approached his line.
</p>
<p>They halted at this unexpected summons. The
officer in command of them took a hasty survey of
the situation, and then ordered his troops to cut
their way through the thin line between them and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
the rebel field-works. The commander of the rebel
pickets was a gallant fellow; and, drawing his
sword, he rushed towards the spot where the lieutenant
was stationed. Discharging his pistol with
the left hand at Somers, he dashed forward like a
festive horse.
</p>
<p>Both parties had discharged their guns, and
there was no time to reload them. Some of the
rebels had bayonets, and some had not; and, with
the fury of their brave leader, they attempted to
break their way through the line. A sharp but very
irregular conflict ensued, the rebels clubbing their
muskets or grappling with the Union soldiers, each
according to his individual taste. As they were
two to one of the Federals, they would certainly
have won the field if Captain de Banyan had not
promptly come to the rescue.
</p>
<p>The excited rebel officer manifested a most persistent
desire to revenge his misfortunes upon
Lieutenant Somers. After he had fired his pistol
twice, and one of the balls had passed through his
opponent&#8217;s cap, the latter, by a sudden dash,
knocked the weapon from his hand with his sword.
He then attempted to use his own sword, and, if
Somers had not been a &#8220;master of fence,&#8221; would
probably have run him through the body. Some
hard blows were struck with these weapons, and
the age of chivalry, when men fought hand to hand
with trusty blades, seemed to be revived. But the
sword of the rebel officer was not so trusty as it
ought to have been. It was not a regulation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
sword; and, while its owner was flourishing it most
valiantly, the blade flew away from the handle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, surrender!&#8221; said Somers, out of breath
with the violence of his exertions, as he drew from
his belt the pistol which, being so hard pressed, he
had not been able to use before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never, sir! I don&#8217;t surrender! I was sent
here to fight, and not to surrender!&#8221; replied the
officer, as proudly as though he had been in command
of a beleaguered fortress, instead of a squad
of two or three dozen men.
</p>
<p>Somers had him at his mercy, and it seemed but
little better than murder to shoot him in his defenseless
state.
</p>
<p>That was a bad mistake on his part; for the
rebel officer at once proceeded to prove that he was
no effeminate character, who depended upon a
sword, pistol, or other weapon, to fight his battles
with, but could, if occasion required, defend himself
with his naked arm. He sprang upon Somers
with the ferocity of a tiger. The latter fired; but
the sudden movement of the former impaired his
aim, and the ball whistled harmlessly over the head
of the rebel. The desperate officer attempted to
gain possession of the pistol; but Somers, now
thoroughly aroused to a sense of his own danger,
sprang at the throat of his antagonist, and, by
the fierceness of the dash, bore him to the earth.
His victim struggled to escape; and, being a
stronger man than the other, would certainly have
succeeded, if Somers had not picked up his pistol,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
which lay on the spot where they fell, and struck a
blow with the butt of it on the temple of the rebel.
This effectually quieted him; but the lieutenant&#8217;s
little force were falling back before the furious
assaults of the graybacks.
</p>
<p>He had only time to get up before the rebels
were upon him. At this interesting and critical
moment, Captain de Banyan came up with his
large force; and the enemy, finding themselves
pressed in front and rear, gave up in despair.
They were disarmed; and, those from the wheat-field
being brought forward, the whole squad were
marched in the direction of the Union line.
</p>
<p>About one-half of Somers&#8217;s men were wounded,
though some but slightly. These were sent back.
The rebel officer lay insensible upon the ground;
but Somers, satisfied that he was only stunned, desired
to carry him off, not only as a trophy of his
prowess, but because such a desperate fellow
would be less dangerous in a prison-camp than in
the lines of the rebels. He directed two of his men
to bear the insensible form to the house, whither
they were followed by the remainder of the force.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, my dear fellow, give me your hand,&#8221;
said Captain de Banyan, as soon as the pressing
business of the moment had been disposed of.
&#8220;You have covered yourself with glory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; replied Somers, trying to look indifferent.
&#8220;I have only done my duty, and obeyed my
orders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very true; but, if you had been weak in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
the knees, you couldn&#8217;t very well have obeyed
orders. Somers, you have done a big thing; and,
in my judgment, you ought to be promoted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Promoted for that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the battle of Magenta&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, confound the battle of Magenta!&#8221; exclaimed
Somers, interrupting him. &#8220;I will give
you a handsome present if you will never say
Magenta to me again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be petulant, my dear boy! You have
got a sweet temper naturally, and I hope you won&#8217;t
spoil it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid you will spoil it for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only saying pleasant things to you, and
you fly off and roll yourself up in your dignity like
a little hedgehog. By the way, Somers, don&#8217;t you
suppose that Senator Guilford will hear of this
affair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor that little lady we left all used up with a
broken arm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care whether she does or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or that other little lady who knits socks for
soldiers that don&#8217;t run away in battle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers blushed like a maiden, and his experienced
companion saw that he had touched the
tender spot in his heart. Very likely the captain
would have said something more on this interesting
subject, if the conversation had not been interrupted
by their arrival at the old house. Here they
were met by a messenger from the colonel, ordering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
the detachment to hasten back; for orders had
come for the brigade to retire to their old position.
</p>
<p>The wounded and the prisoners were conducted
safely back to the line in the woods, where our
party were warmly congratulated upon their decided
success. The brigade fell back, but were immediately
ordered forward again, and held the advanced
position which had been so gallantly won. It
was not a very comfortable place; for the soldiers
stood over shoes in the water. Late in the evening,
our regiment was relieved by another, and ordered
back to the breastworks in the rear. It had lost
but few men, though torrents of loyal blood had
flowed on that eventful day.
</p>
<p>The action of that day was the initial conflict of
the seven-days&#8217; battles. General McClellan actually
commenced his long-deferred operations
against the city of Richmond. But the favorable
moment had passed by, and even then the battalions
of the rebels were gathering in readiness to
be hurled upon our devoted army. While the regiment,
whose fortunes have been more intimately
connected with our story, was retiring from the
pestiferous swamp, the commanding general received
information of the approach of Stonewall
Jackson. These proved to be sad tidings; for the
anticipated triumphal march into the rebel capital
was changed into a bloody but glorious retreat.
The battles which were to be fought for a victorious
advance were made to cover a disastrous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
defeat&mdash;disastrous to the campaign, though not to
the army.
</p>
<p>Fatigued, hungry and chilled by the night damps
of the swamp, the regiment threaded its way
through the intricacies of the woods towards the
breastworks in the rear. It was a dark and gloomy
hour, though the <i>prestige</i> of victory dwelt in the
souls of the gallant soldiers. The officers were not
familiar with the ground; and with difficulty they
found their way back to the old line.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Somers, how do you feel?&#8221; asked Captain
de Banyan when the regiment was dismissed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all worn out. I haven&#8217;t got toughened to
this kind of work yet,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give it up yet, my boy. We shall be in
Richmond in less than a week, and then we will
take rooms at the Spottswood House, and have
a good time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe we shall ever get into Richmond,
captain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I do. Everything is working to my
entire satisfaction. You feel a little blue, my boy;
but it is only because you are tired. You will feel
better in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am tired, but I am not blue. I am ready to
do my duty, in victory or defeat. There has been
an awful roar of guns all day, and no one can tell
what the result of a battle will be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An awful roar of guns! &#8217;Pon my word, I
like that,&#8221; laughed the captain. &#8220;Why, at Magenta&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Magenta again!&#8221; sneered Somers, who was
heartily sick of that word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, at Magenta! If you could only have
heard the guns there! Why, there were seven
thousand two hundred and forty-six pieces rattling
away like mad on our side alone; and I believe the
Russians&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Russians at Magenta again! I don&#8217;t believe
you were at the battle of Magenta any more than I
was!&#8221; exclaimed Somers desperately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that I lie?&#8221; asked the
captain gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on with your story,&#8221; said the lieutenant,
fearing that he had said too much.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer my question, if you please. You gave
me the lie; did you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I didn&#8217;t use that word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you didn&#8217;t believe I was at the battle
of Magenta.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To be perfectly candid with you, I don&#8217;t believe
it; but I am tired, and want my supper,&#8221; answered
Somers, wishing to escape the issue which he had
provoked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair play, my boy. You charged me with lying&mdash;indirectly&mdash;but
not the less offensively on that
account. Don&#8217;t dodge the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t dodged it. I gave you my candid
opinion that you were not present at Magenta; and
I don&#8217;t think there is an officer in the regiment who
believes you were there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the word of an officer and a gentleman
to be accepted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, if he keeps within the bounds of reason;
but when you talk about the Russians at
Magenta, and over seven thousand cannons in a
single army, we know that you are either &#8216;drawing
the long-bow,&#8217; or laboring under some strange delusion.
Supper is ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can eat and talk too.&#8221; And they did.
&#8220;May I be allowed to ask, Lieutenant Somers, if
you deem my statement inconsistent with reason?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure I do. We have six guns to a battery;
seventy-two hundred guns would make twelve
hundred batteries. We have about one hundred
and fifty men to a battery, which would make one
hundred and eighty thousand men in the artillery
arm alone; which is positively ridiculous. You
said Russians&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, that was a slip of the tongue. I
meant Prussians,&#8221; added the captain, entirely overwhelmed
by the lieutenant&#8217;s arithmetic, as well as
by the laughter of Captain Benson and Lieutenant
Munroe, who belonged to the mess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse yet,&#8221; said Somers. &#8220;They were Austrians.
Now, captain, you are a brave man, and a
splendid fellow; but I think it is a great pity you
should tell such abominably great stories.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I accept the apology,&#8221; laughed Captain de
Banyan. &#8220;We will call it square, and turn in;
for I think that we shall have hot work to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AN ORDER FROM HEADQUARTERS</h3>
</div>

<p>While Captain de Banyan and Lieutenant
Somers were asleep, the commanding general received
the intelligence of a movement on our right
by the famous Stonewall Jackson. The position
which had been gained by the advance at Oak
Grove was abandoned, and the troops returned to
their old line. The next day was heard the roar
of the guns at Mechanicsville; and on that succeeding
was fought the battle of Gaines&#8217;s Mills&mdash;the
only defeat in the field sustained by the Union
army during that battle-week.
</p>
<p>General McClellan then decided to change his
base of operations; which, rendered into plain
English, meant that he had been flanked, and was
obliged to make the best move he could to save his
army and material. The troops fought all day,
and ran all night, till they reached the James
River, where they were protected by the all-powerful
gunboats. In the battles of Savage&#8217;s Station,
Glendale and Malvern Hills, they were victorious,
and fought as no troops had ever fought before.
As a retreat, it was successful; but it was the sad
and inglorious end of the Peninsular campaign.
</p>
<p>The whole brigade to which Lieutenant Somers
belonged went on picket every third day. While
the tremendous operations to which we have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
briefly alluded were taking place on the right, the
soldiers on the left were leading their ordinary
military life. But they were thinking men, and,
while they were firm in their devotion to the good
cause, they were disturbed by doubts and fears.
They knew not, as they listened to the booming
guns, whether they were in the midst of victory or
defeat. Occasionally, they were shelled behind
their breastworks; apparently for the purpose, on
the part of the rebels, of keeping our forces from
interfering with the work on the right.
</p>
<p>The brigade went on picket, and here the troops
were face to face with the enemy. Lieutenant
Somers, by the illness of the captain and the absence
of the first lieutenant, was in command of
his company. But there was no chance to do anything
to distinguish himself, except that steady
and patient attention to duty which is the constant
opportunity of every good officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, captain, was there anything like this at
Magenta?&#8221; asked Somers, as he met De Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is tame, Somers. Magenta was a lively
scene.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy it will not remain tame much longer.
We shall either be in Richmond as victors or
prisoners within a few days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t croak, Somers. It will all come out right
in the end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt of that; but I feel just as
though some big thing was going to happen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I; and I felt so just before the battle of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Solferino. By the way, on the night before that
battle, I captured a whole brigade with my single
company, while I was out on picket-duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; laughed Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take that trouble, captain; for I shall
not believe you if you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to doubt my word, even before I
utter it?&#8221; demanded the captain, apparently much
hurt by the insinuation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan, I wish I could persuade
you to speak the truth at all times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Somers, that&#8217;s rather a grave charge;
and, if it came from any other man than yourself,
I should challenge him on the spot,&#8221; added the
captain, throwing back his head, and looking dignified
enough to be the commander-in-chief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may challenge me if you please; but let
us be serious for a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am serious, and have been all the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a first-rate fellow, captain; I like you
almost as well as I do my own brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a sensible young man, Somers,&#8221; replied
De Banyan, slightly relaxing the rigid muscles of
his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a brave man, and as brilliant as you
are brave. I have only one fault to find with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will draw the long-bow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, I will lie. Somers, you hurt
my feelings. I took a fancy to you the first time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
I ever saw you, and it pains me to hear you talk
in that manner. Do you think that I, an officer
and a gentleman, would stoop to the vice of lying?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly do not expect any one to believe
those wretched big stories you tell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I do,&#8221; replied the captain with
dignity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But they contradict themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you don&#8217;t believe there ever was such
an event as the battle of Magenta.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, my friend; just slide off that high
horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, my word has been doubted;
my good faith maligned; my character for truth
and veracity questioned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know all that very well; but answer me
one question, captain. Seriously and solemnly,
were you at the battle of Magenta?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I decline to answer one who doubts my veracity.
If I answered you in the affirmative, you
would not believe me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I should; but, if you should answer
me in the negative, I should have full faith in
your reply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot answer on those terms. Somers, I am
offended. I don&#8217;t know but that I am in duty
bound to challenge you. Just after the battle of
Magenta, I felt compelled to challenge a young
officer who cast an imputation upon my word. We
fought, and he fell. His brother challenged me
then, and I had to put a bullet through his head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
The family were Corsicans, I believe; and one after
another challenged me, till they got down to fifth
cousins; and I laid out fifteen of them&mdash;I think
it was fifteen; I don&#8217;t remember the exact number,
but I could tell by referring to my diary. You are
so precise and particular, that I want to give you
the facts just as they are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t the diary with you, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not; I couldn&#8217;t carry a volume like
that around with me. I only mention this circumstance
to show you the sad results which sometimes
follow in the wake of a duel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not a Corsican; and I don&#8217;t think you
need fear any such results in my case, if you should
conclude to challenge me,&#8221; answered Somers with
abundant good nature.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, seriously and solemnly, Somers, this
doubting a comrade&#8217;s word is a vicious habit. It
shows that you have no confidence in what I say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is precisely the truth; but I think you are
responsible for the fact, not I. If you would only
tell the truth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell the truth! My dear fellow, you keep
making the matter worse, instead of better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do you; for, instead of abandoning your bad
habit, you tell me an absurd story about killing
fifteen men in a series of duels!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I couldn&#8217;t fix the exact number.
You are too critical by half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not particular about the number; for I
don&#8217;t believe you killed even a single person in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
duel. You are too good a fellow to do anything of
the sort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, I have been laboring to keep my temper;
but I am afraid you will make me mad, if you
keep on. I think we had better suspend this conversation
before it leads to any unhappy results;&#8221;
and the captain rose from the ground, and glanced
in the direction of the enemy&#8217;s pickets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The most unhappy result I could conceive of
would be your continuing this bad practice of telling
big stories,&#8221; replied Somers, standing up by
the side of his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No more; you add insult to injury, Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, captain, you injure yourself by this
habit, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Captain de Banyan, at this point of the conversation,
suddenly turned round, and sprang upon
the lieutenant, bearing him to the ground before
the latter could even make a movement in self-defense.
Together they rolled upon the earth, at the
foot of the tree whose sheltering branches had protected
them from the intense heat of the sun.
Somers, as the reader already knows, was bold and
belligerent before an attack; and, on the impulse of
the moment, he proceeded to repel the sharp assault
of his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you fight a duel in that way, I am ready to
take part in it,&#8221; said he, his face red with anger.
&#8220;Let go of me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure, my dear boy,&#8221; replied De Banyan,
edging away from him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by pitching into me in that
way?&#8221; demanded Somers angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been trying this half hour to teach you
a useful lesson; but you don&#8217;t know who your best
friends are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I do. Some of them tell the truth sometimes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers!&#8221; said the captain sternly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan!&#8221; replied the lieutenant
firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that hole in the tree?&#8221; continued
Captain de Banyan, pointing to a fresh bullet-mark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only pulled you down to keep that rifle-ball
from going through your head. I saw a rebel
picket through the trees, ready to fire at us. The
ball struck the tree before we struck the ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, captain. I did not understand the
movement,&#8221; replied Somers, extending his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With all my heart,&#8221; replied the captain, taking
the proffered hand. &#8220;We don&#8217;t always know
who our best friends are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not; but I know that you are one of
my best friends. You have just given me another
reason for wishing you did not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Somers hesitated,
not thinking it exactly fair to reproach his
companion for his vile habit, after he had rendered
him such a signal service.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie,&#8221; added De Banyan, finishing the sentence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it isn&#8217;t exactly lying; you don&#8217;t mean
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
to deceive any one. At the worst, they are only
white lies. Now, captain, don&#8217;t you think you exaggerate
sometimes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps I do; my memory is rather poor.
I don&#8217;t carry my diary with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it would be better if you could
confine yourself to the exact truth?&#8221; added Somers,
who really felt a deep interest in his associate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it very likely it would; but things get
a little mixed up in my mind. My memory is poor
on details. Just after the battle of Magenta, while
I was lying wounded on the ground, one of the emperor&#8217;s
staff rode up to me, and asked how many
cannon my regiment had captured. To save my
life, I couldn&#8217;t tell whether it was two hundred or
three hundred. My memory is very treacherous
on details.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are hopeless, captain,&#8221; laughed
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopeless?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you have told the biggest story that has
passed your lips to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, about the cannon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred or three hundred! Why, your
regiment captured all the guns the Austrians had!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you I couldn&#8217;t remember whether
it was two hundred or three hundred? You are
the most critical young man I ever met in the
whole course of my life!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But two hundred would be an abominable exaggeration.
Perhaps you meant muskets?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No; cannon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear captain, just consider for one moment.
Of course the batteries were supported?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure they were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Six guns to a battery would have made fifty
batteries; and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, confound your statistics!&#8221; exclaimed the
captain impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But statistics enable us to see the truth. Now,
captain, at the battle of Bunker Hill, I saw a
man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; demanded Captain de Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you at the battle of Bunker Hill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see me there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, Somers; you shouldn&#8217;t trifle with
the truth. I was not at the battle you speak of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You! You were not born till sixty years after
the battle of Bunker Hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I was&mdash;only illustrating your case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes an orderly with something from
headquarters,&#8221; said Captain de Banyan, apparently
as much rejoiced to change the conversation
as the reader will be to have it changed.
</p>
<p>The orderly proceeded to the position occupied
by the field and staff officers of the regiment; and,
a few moments later, came an order for Lieutenant
Somers, with twenty of his men, selected for special
duty, to report at the division headquarters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in luck, Somers; you will have a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
glorious opportunity to distinguish yourself,&#8221; said
Captain de Banyan, whose second lieutenant was
ordered to the command of Somers&#8217;s company.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it means,&#8221; replied our lieutenant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you, indeed?&#8221; added the captain with a
smile. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what special duty means?
On the night before the battle of Solferino&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Captain de Banyan; but I am
ordered to report forthwith,&#8221; interrupted Somers,
who had no desire to hear another &#8220;whopper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young lieutenant marched off, with his little
force, to report as he had been directed. He knew
his men well enough to enable him to make a good
selection; and he was confident that they would
stand by him to the last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know Senator Guilford?&#8221; demanded
the general, after Somers had passed through all
the forms of reporting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, general,&#8221; replied the lieutenant, with a
fearful blush, and with a wish in his heart that
the distinguished Senator had minded his own
business.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He speaks well of you, Lieutenant Somers,&#8221;
added the general.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very much obliged to him for his kindness;
but I never saw him but once in my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He asks a favor for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very much obliged to him; but I don&#8217;t ask
any for myself, and I hope you will not grant it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
If any favors are bestowed upon me, I prefer to
earn them myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed the general. &#8220;But I assure
you and Senator Guilford that no man in this
division of the army will get a position he does not
deserve. I assure you, Lieutenant Somers, I
should have thrown the Senator&#8217;s letter among the
waste paper, if I had not known you before. I remember
you at Williamsburg; and you did a pretty
thing in the wheat-field yesterday. You are just
the man I want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir; I should be very glad to prove
that your good opinion is well founded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Apart from others, and in a low tone, the general
gave his orders to Lieutenant Somers to undertake
a very difficult and dangerous scouting
expedition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before sundown you will be a prisoner in Richmond,
or a first lieutenant,&#8221; added the general as
Somers withdrew.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>LIEUTENANT SOMERS CHANGES HIS NAME AND CHARACTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Like the major-generals in the army, Lieutenant
Somers had strong aspirations in the direction
of an independent command. Like those distinguished
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
worthies, no doubt, he felt competent to
perform bigger things than he had yet been called
to achieve in the ordinary routine of duty. He had
the blood of heroes in his veins; and, in spite of
all he could do to keep his thoughts within the
limits of modesty, he found them soaring to the
regions of the improbable and fanciful. His
imagination led him a wild race, and pictured him
in the act of performing marvelous deeds of valor
and skill.
</p>
<p>Fancy is a blind and reckless leader; and it gave
our hero oftentimes a command which his reason
would not have permitted him to accept. What
boys, and even what men, think, when stimulated
by ambition, would be too ridiculous to put upon
paper. If their thoughts could be disclosed to
the impertinent eye of the world, the proprietors
would blushingly disown and disclaim them.
</p>
<p>Still, almost every live man and boy gives the
reins to his fancy; and in the Army of the Potomac,
we will venture to say, there were a hundred
thousand privates and officers who permitted themselves
to dream that they were brigadiers and
major-generals; that they did big things, and received
the grateful homage of the world. At any
rate, Lieutenant Somers did, modest as he was,
even while he felt that he was utterly incompetent
to perform the duties incumbent on the two stars
or the one star.
</p>
<p>Experience had given him some confidence in
his own powers; and there was something delightful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
in the idea of having an independent command.
It was a partial, a very partial, realization of the
wanderings of his vivid fancy. He felt able to do
something which Lilian Ashford would take pleasure
in reading in the newspapers; perhaps something
which would prove his fitness for a brigadier&#8217;s
star at some remote period. Now, we have
made all this explanation to show how Somers had
prepared himself to accomplish some great thing.
The mission with which he had been intrusted was
an important one; and the safety of the whole left
wing of the army might depend upon its faithful
performance.
</p>
<p>He was wrought up to the highest pitch of patriotic
inspiration by the charge which had been
laid upon him; and he was determined to bring
back the information required of him, even if he
had to fly through the air to obtain it. It was of
no use to suggest impossibilities to a young man
in such a frame of mind; he did not know the
meaning of the word. To impress him with the
importance of the duty intrusted to him, the general
of division had given him a faint outline of the
intended movements of the army. If the enemy
massed his forces in this direction, it was of vital
necessity that the general should know it.
</p>
<p>Thus prepared and thus inspired, Lieutenant
Somers marched his little force to the point from
which he proposed to operate. On his right hand
there was a dense wood, on the border of which
extended one of the numerous cross-roads that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
checker the country. On his left was another piece
of woods, terminating in a point about a quarter
of a mile from the road and in the center of a
valley.
</p>
<p>On the hill beyond was the intrenched line of
the rebels. In front of it, at the foot of the slope,
was a line of rifle-pits, which were occupied by the
rebel pickets. The hill and the woods concealed
the operations of the enemy; and no signal station
was high enough to obtain the necessary information.
The woods on both sides of the open space
were picketed by the rebels; and the rifle-pits in
front were an effectual check to the advance of a
small force, while a large one could not be sent
up without bringing on a general engagement,
which had been prohibited by the commanding
general.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers surveyed the ground, and
came to the conclusion that his chance of spending
the night in Libby Prison was better than his
chance of being made a first lieutenant. The rifle-pits
had a chilling effect upon the fine dreams in
which his fancy had indulged. He was not a grub,
and could not burrow through the earth to the
rebel lines; he had no wings, and could not fly over
them. The obstacles which are so easily overcome
in one&#8217;s dreams appear mountain-high in real life.
He looked troubled and anxious; but, having put
his hand to the plow, he was determined not to
turn back.
</p>
<p>The best way to conquer a difficulty is to charge
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
upon it; and this Somers decided to do, even
though he had no well-defined plan for the accomplishment
of his purpose. Avoiding the observation
of the rebels in the rifle-pits, he moved round,
and reached the point of woods on the left of the
road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Lieutenant Somers,&#8221; said Sergeant
Hapgood with a military salute: &#8220;&#8217;tain&#8217;t none o&#8217;
my business, but I&#8217;d like to know where you are
goin&#8217; to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Through this woods,&#8221; replied Somers doggedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You used to be a good boy, when you was a
boy; and I hope you&#8217;ve said your prayers,&#8221; replied
old Hapgood, appalled at the prospect before his
young friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you croak, uncle,&#8221; added Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rebels&#8217; pickets are up here, not twenty
rods distant. Do you calculate to go through them,
or over them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Either&mdash;just as I can; but I am going through,
somehow or other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be done! Thunderation! you&#8217;ll bring
down the whole rebel army upon us! You don&#8217;t
think of going over there with only twenty men!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, uncle. I&#8217;m going over on that hill yonder,
and I&#8217;m coming back again before night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hapgood tapped his forehead significantly with
his finger to indicate that the young lieutenant had
lost his senses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ordered to do it, and I am going to do it,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
uncle. You can set your mind at rest on that
point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be did!&#8221; said the old man positively.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t keer who told you to do it; it can&#8217;t be did
with less&#8217;n twenty thousand men. You will sacrifice
yourself and all the rest of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may return to the camp, if you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Somers&mdash;Lieutenant Somers,&#8221; said the
old man, much hurt by the words of the young
officer, &#8220;you know I&#8217;m not afraid of anything; and
I didn&#8217;t expect you&#8217;d say that to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, uncle; I didn&#8217;t mean it. Now, hear
me a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a low tone, Lieutenant Somers told the sergeant
the nature of his mission, and what depended
upon its prompt and successful execution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to have sent a division to do such a
job,&#8221; muttered the old man, taking off his cap, and
scratching his bald head. &#8220;Howsomever, I&#8217;m
ready to follow you wherever you choose to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward, then,&#8221; replied Somers; and they advanced
cautiously through the woods till they came
to a kind of bog-hole, beyond which they discovered
the rebel pickets.
</p>
<p>The party lay down on the ground, and crawled
on the edge of the bog, till they obtained a fair
view of the rebels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, uncle, the time has come, and my plan
is formed,&#8221; said Somers in a whisper. &#8220;When
they discover you, retreat with the men as fast as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
you can. Fire on the rebels; but don&#8217;t pay any
attention to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; demanded the old man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you retire, I am going to roll into that
grass. They will follow you; and, as soon as they
have passed me, I shall move forward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do anything of the sort. Thunderation!
you are goin&#8217; to run right into the arms of
the rebels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Obey my orders! That&#8217;s all you have to do.
I can take care of myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Tom&mdash;Lieutenant Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know all about it, uncle. You do what I tell
you, and you shall have all the particulars to-night,
when I return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Return! You will be in Libby, if you are not
shot, by dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am, leave that to me,&#8221; replied Somers, as
he rolled over into the long grass of the bog, and
entirely concealed himself from the view of his
own men. &#8220;Now fire one or two shots into the
rebel picket and then retire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hapgood reluctantly obeyed the order; though
he felt as though he was signing the death-warrant
of his young friend by doing so. The bullets began
to fly; but the sergeant took care to keep his men
out of sight as they retreated. The enemy followed;
for they always chase a retiring foe, and
run from an advancing one. They reached the bog
in which Somers was concealed, where one of the
three fell before a ball which the lieutenant was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
sure had been directed by the practiced eye of the
veteran sergeant. The other two swore at the
calamity, and vowed vengeance on the Yankee who
had done the deed.
</p>
<p>Hapgood continued to retire, and led his foe to
the very verge of the woods. In the meantime, the
lieutenant emerged from his hiding-place. The
first object that attracted his attention was the
ghastly face of the dead rebel. The sight of him
was not pleasant, but it was suggestive; and, without
the loss of a moment, he dragged the body into
the grass, and hastily removed the uniform from
it. It was a loathsome task; but the necessity of
the moment seemed to justify the act. Taking off
his own uniform, he put on that of the dead rebel,
who was fortunately about his own size. Rolling
up his own clothing in as small a bundle as possible,
he concealed it in the bog, at some distance
from the place where the picket had fallen. Dragging
the corpse to a quagmire, he sunk it beneath
the muddy waters, and it passed from his view.
After taking the precaution to straighten up the
long grass, which might have betrayed his movements,
he advanced towards the rebel lines.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers felt that he was now actually
embarked in his perilous venture. He was within
the enemy&#8217;s line, and in disguise. If discovered, he
would be liable to the penalty of being a spy. But
inasmuch as he did not intend to be discovered,
he did not think it necessary to expend his nervous
energy in a discussion of this question. Success
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
was a duty to him; and he spent no time in considering
the dark side of the picture.
</p>
<p>He was excited, and he knew that he was excited.
He knew that coolness and impudence were
the essential elements of success in such an adventure;
and when he had followed the woods
nearly to the top of the hill, he sat down to recover
his self-possession, and compose his nerves to their
natural quietude. It was not a very easy matter.
He had already arranged his plan of future operations,
and he diligently set about the business of
making his appearance correspond with his circumstances.
</p>
<p>He felt that he was hardly dirty enough to be
a rebel; so he rubbed his face, neck and hands with
some dark-colored earth, ripped his pants and coat
in sundry places, and otherwise disfigured his
comely person, till Miss Lilian Ashford would not
have known him, or if she had known him,
would have been ashamed to acknowledge his acquaintance.
Having completed this work to his
entire satisfaction, he rose, and resumed his march
towards the rebel line. He had advanced but a
few paces before he felt something in the breast-pocket
of his coat, which excited his curiosity. It
was a diary which the dead soldier had kept from
the time he entered the army.
</p>
<p>Such a work would have been deeply interesting
to the lieutenant at any time, but especially at the
present, when he was sadly in want of the information
which would enable him to personate the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
difficult part he had chosen to perform. Seating
himself on the ground again, he was soon absorbed
in the contents of the note-book. The owner&#8217;s
name was Owen Raynes; and from the diary
Somers learned that he had been a clerk in Richmond
when the war broke out; and that his father
resided on the Williamsburg road, near Seven
Pines, where the battle had been fought. Somers
was alarmed at this information; for the young
man must be well known in the neighborhood. Of
course he could not assume the name and character
of Owen Raynes.
</p>
<p>Though the time was precious, he continued to
read the diary till he came to an entry which excited
his deep interest: &#8220;Poor Allan Garland was
captured to-day by the Yankees; and I suppose
they will torture and starve the poor fellow, as
they have the rest of our boys who have fallen into
their hands. We shall never meet again. He was
a good fellow. He was on a scout.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers was deeply concerned about poor Allan
Garland, who had fallen into the hands of the terrible
Yankees, to be tortured and starved; and he
turned back to the beginning of the diary to obtain
further particulars in regard to this interesting
person. Fortunately for history, and particularly
for Lieutenant Somers, Owen Raynes had given a
tolerably full account of his friend. They had
been to school together in Union, Alabama, where
Owen had an uncle, and where Allan resided.
They were fast friends; and both agreed to enlist
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
as volunteers in the Fourth Alabama, Colonel Bush
Jones; for their schoolmates were mostly in this
regiment.
</p>
<p>When the regiment arrived at Richmond, Owen
had not time to visit his father; for the troops
were instantly ordered to Manassas, and he enrolled
himself without discovering that his friend
was not in the ranks. He was too sick to come
with his comrades; &#8220;wrote letter to Allan&#8221; was a
frequent entry in the diary, until June 18, 1862,
when this record appears: &#8220;Allan joined the regiment
to-day; has been sick about a year; is very
well now; he is a handsome fellow. Sue shall be
his wife, if I can bring it about; they have kept up
a correspondence for three years; she never saw
him, but she will like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; exclaimed Somers, as he closed the
book, and put it in his pocket. &#8220;I am Allan Garland.
Don&#8217;t think I shall marry Sue, though, whoever
she may be. I wonder if Lilian Ashford
would object. I don&#8217;t know as she would. Never
mind; I am a soldier of the Fourth Alabama,
Colonel Jones, just now. How are you, Allan
Garland?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked along towards the rebel lines, feeling
in his pockets for further revelations. An old
letter from Allan Garland rewarded his search.
He spoke tenderly of Sue, who was Owen&#8217;s sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sue wouldn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m very handsome just
now,&#8221; said Somers, glancing at his dirty hands,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
and imagining his dirty face, as he continued to
advance.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>ALLAN GARLAND AND FRIENDS</h3>
</div>

<p>Allan Garland, <i>née</i> Somers, advanced confidently
towards the rebel line. As he was to perform
the leading part in the exciting drama about
to be acted, he conducted himself with the utmost
caution. Everything depended upon the amount
of impudence he could bring to bear upon the case
before him, and the skill with which he personated
the part he had chosen. He knew of nothing,
short of falling on the Fourth Alabama, which
could disconcert him. Even if he did, there were
only a few who knew the captured scout; and his
chances were fair, even if the worst should befall
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand!&#8221; said a rebel sentinel on the breastwork
of the line. &#8220;Who goes there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend,&#8221; replied Somers confidently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Allan Garland. Can you tell me where the
Fourth Alabama is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About four miles from here. Do you belong
to the Fourth Alabama?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I did before I was captured; I don&#8217;t
know where I belong now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where d&#8217;ye come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just got away from the Yankees. They gobbled
me up about three weeks ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for you! Come in; you can report to
the officer of the day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers was entirely willing, and hastened in the
direction indicated by the sentinel; and was soon
ushered into the presence of Major Platner,
brigade-officer of the day. He was a very pompous
little man, and Somers saw his weakness as soon
as he spoke. With a most profound bow, he answered
the questions of the major, using the utmost
deference in his tone and manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you present yourself before an officer
of the day with such a dirty face?&#8221; demanded
Major Platner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope your honor will pardon me; but I have
just escaped from the Yankees, and have not had
time to wash my face. If you please, sir, I will go
and do it now. I thought I ought to come to you
without any delay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did right, young man,&#8221; replied the major
with a consequential flourish of the hand. &#8220;You
were out scouting when you were taken?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Major Platner then proceeded to ask a great
many questions in regard to the force and position
of the Yankees; all of which Somers answered entirely
in the interest of the Union party. He was
very careful not to give a particle of information
that could be useful to the rebels; at the same time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
avoiding any gross exaggerations which would
throw discredit on his story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be a very intelligent and patriotic
young man,&#8221; added the officer. &#8220;I have heard
some inquiries for a person of your description
to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always endeavored to do my duty to
my country,&#8221; answered Somers, trying to blush
under the compliment of the patronizing little
major; &#8220;and I kept my eyes wide open while I was
in the Yankee camps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you did. Your information is very
definite, and, I doubt not, very reliable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My only desire has been to serve my country,
sir,&#8221; added Somers very modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, go and wash your face, so that we can
see what color you are, and I will report your
name to the general, who was inquiring for a useful
person like yourself. I trust that you will
have discretion enough not to mention anything
that has passed between us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not, sir. I judge, from what you
have said, that my poor services may be required
for some special service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the idea which I intended to convey.
In a word, the commander of this division wants
information. You have just come from the
Yankee lines, and you know where to look for the
intelligence that will be of the most value to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I do, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that you have just made your way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
through the Yankee lines shows that you possess
the necessary address.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for your good opinion; and I assure
you, sir, that I should be very glad to serve
my country in any capacity in which she may require
my humble labors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, young man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A plan occurs to me now, by which I could
easily enter the Yankee lines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! What is that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I ran through the enemy&#8217;s pickets, they
fired upon me, and one of them chased me. I
brought him down with my pistol,&#8221; replied Somers,
producing the weapon, which he had taken the
precaution to bring with him. &#8220;I know just where
that Yankee lies now; I could borrow his uniform,
and go in among the enemy without suspicion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well arranged, young man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The major then directed an orderly to attend to
the wants of the fugitive, and gave the latter
orders to report to him within two hours. Somers
washed his face, and partook of some cold bacon
and corn bread, which constituted the staple of the
rebel rations. He then told the orderly that he
wanted to look round a little, and find his regiment,
if he could; but was informed that the camp
regulations did not permit any strolling about the
camps. He suggested that the officer of the day
would give him a pass, and he returned to the
major to beg this favor. It was readily granted;
and the time for him to report was extended to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
four hours, as his regiment was situated at some
distance from the brigade camp, though it belonged
to the same division.
</p>
<p>Thus provided, Somers commenced his tour of
observation. Of course, he had no intention of
visiting the Fourth Alabama; for that would have
been putting his head into the lion&#8217;s mouth. We
need only say, that he used his time to the best
advantage for the country in whose service he had
enlisted. He noted the brigades, regiments, and
batteries of artillery, which he saw in his walk;
and arranged a little scheme in his mind, by which
he could remember the number of each.
</p>
<p>In the course of his perambulations, he reached
the Williamsburg road, and was on the point of
extending his observations in the direction of the
railroad, when he was stopped by a sentinel. He
produced his pass, which the rebel soldier could not
read; and he was conducted to the sergeant of the
guard, who was listening to a conversation between
a captain and an old man who appeared to be a
farmer. They were bargaining about some forage
which the captain wanted, and which the farmer
was not disposed to sell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you there?&#8221; demanded the officer,
as the sentinel brought in the doubtful case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man with a pass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your pass is good up to the Williamsburg
road, and no farther,&#8221; said the sergeant when he
had read the document.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where the lines were,&#8221; replied
Somers, returning the pass to his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked the officer, apparently
not satisfied with the appearance of the
&#8220;man with a pass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking for my regiment, sir,&#8221; replied Somers,
giving the military salute; which excess of politeness,
however, was lost on the matter-of-fact
captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What regiment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fourth Alabama.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fourth Alabama! What are you doing
over here, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a stranger in these parts; and I don&#8217;t
know where to look. I have just escaped from the
Yankees, and don&#8217;t know much about this part of
the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Allan Garland, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed the old farmer, suddenly
becoming interested in the conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, you are a deserter,&#8221; added the
officer in a crabbed tone. &#8220;I advise you to arrest
him, sergeant. That pass is good for nothing on
this road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, captain, he is not a deserter,&#8221; interposed
the farmer with energy. &#8220;I know him well; and
he is as true and patriotic a young man as there is
in the Southern Confederacy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers looked at the farmer with astonishment.
He did not remember to have seen him before; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
he could not account for the interest he manifested
in his case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know of him, Mr. Raynes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Raynes! That explained the matter; and
Somers could not help shuddering in the presence
of the man whose son he had buried in the soft mud
of the bog.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is my son&#8217;s friend,&#8221; replied the farmer.
&#8220;Both of them belong to the Fourth Alabama.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be, Mr. Raynes; but do you suppose
a man looking for the Fourth Alabama would be
wandering about here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a stranger in Virginia. He came on
from Alabama only a few weeks since, and was
captured while out on a scouting expedition. I
assure you, captain, it is all right; I will vouch
for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Raynes! If the sergeant is
willing to take your word for it, I have nothing further
to say. Indeed, it is no business of mine;
but our soldiers are allowed to walk over to the
enemy, or back into the woods, without let or
hindrance. It&#8217;s a disgrace to the service. Major
Platner gives this man a pass to go all over the
country. Do as you please, sergeant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to,&#8221; replied the sergeant in an undertone;
for he was not pleased at this interference
on the part of a commissary of subsistence, who
had nothing whatever to do with the affair. &#8220;I
am satisfied,&#8221; he added aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Allan, I am very glad to see you; and I thank
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
God that you have been enabled to escape from the
Yankees. Have you seen Owen since you got
back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers trembled at the question; and, while he
did not dare to tell the old man the truth, the
thought of telling him a falsehood was utterly repulsive
to his nature. It was easy enough to deceive
the enemy in war&mdash;his duty called upon him
to do this; but to deceive an old, fond father, in
regard to a true and devoted son, seemed terrible
to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was out on picket when I came through,&#8221;
he replied after some hesitation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you did not meet him. He will be delighted
to see you again; for really the boy is as
fond of you as he is of his sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers found himself unable to answer to the
warm congratulations of the old man, or to enter
into the spirit of the conversation. The staring,
death-sealed eyes of Owen Raynes haunted him;
and, when he attempted to reciprocate the friendly
sentiments of the doting father, his heart seemed
to rise up in his throat, and choke his utterance.
The only consolation he could derive from the remembrance
of the scene in the woods was in the
fact that he had not taken the life of Owen Raynes
himself. He wore his clothes, and had his diary
and letters in his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very sad, Allan! I should think you
would be happy to escape from the Yankees. They
would have starved you to death in time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think not, sir! They are not so cruel as
that,&#8221; added Somers, who desired to remove such
a reproach from the mind of the old man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they would not willingly starve their
prisoners; but I don&#8217;t see how they could avoid it.
They say that the people of the North are suffering
terribly for the want of food. In New York, the
laboring classes have attacked the banks and the
flour-stores, urged on by hunger. There will be
terrible times in the North before many months
have gone by. I pity the people there, though it is
their own fault. I hope God will be merciful to
them, and spare them from some of the consequences
of their own folly. I am thankful that
you have escaped from them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they are quite so badly off as you
say,&#8221; answered Somers, provoked by this view of
the condition and resources of the North. &#8220;I have
talked with a great many Yankee soldiers, and
they say that plenty abounds in all the Northern
States.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They would tell you so. They are deceived by
their officers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it is done,&#8221; added the rebel
sergeant, who had been listening to the conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I saw what rations these soldiers have.
They live like lords.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very thing which will starve all the
people in the North. Their big armies will eat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
them out of house and home in a few months,
Allan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not, Mr. Raynes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman from New York, who got
through the lines last week, says the grass is a foot
high in some of the streets of New York. The
people can&#8217;t find anything to do, and are cursing
their rulers for plunging them into this horrid
war.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the gentleman from New York lied,&#8221;
replied Somers with a smile. &#8220;I saw the New
York papers every day while I was in the Yankee
lines; and they are full of advertisements, which
look like business. Why, in one paper I saw four
columns of &#8216;Wants,&#8217; in which people advertised for
farm-laborers, house-servants, clerks and sailors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Allan, those papers are printed to sell in
the Yankee army. I&#8217;m sure I hope they are not so
badly off as has been represented. I should not
want my worst enemy to suffer what they are
called upon to endure. It is all their own fault;
but I hope God will be merciful to them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you needn&#8217;t feel bad about them,&#8221;
added Somers, amused, but indignant at the pitiful
stories which were circulated in the South to
keep up the courage of the people.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let that pass, then. Really, Allan, I am very
glad to see you. You must go to the house with
me. Sue will be delighted to meet you. She talks
about you a great deal; and I can insure you a
warm welcome.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I cannot stop to call now; but I will
try to come over in a few days,&#8221; replied Somers,
embarrassed beyond measure at the idea of facing
Sue and the rest of the family.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not stop!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Raynes, holding up
his hands with surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, sir; I am in no condition to appear
before ladies,&#8221; he added, extending his arms so as
to display his tattered garments to the fullest advantage.
&#8220;You know a young man is rather particular
about his appearance when he is going into
the company of ladies, and especially into the presence
of <i>some</i> ladies. The fact is, I tore my uniform
all to pieces after I passed through the
Yankee lines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind your uniform, my boy. It looks
as though it had seen service; and that is the best
recommendation a young man can have to the girls
in these times. You must go, Allan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, sir, I hope you will excuse me for a
few days,&#8221; pleaded Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Allan! this is not kind of you. Sue has
been dying to see you for a year. She was terribly
disappointed when you did not come up with your
regiment, and again when she heard you had joined
without calling upon us. If it had been Owen, she
could not have felt worse when you were captured.
Now you want to disappoint her again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not mention that you have seen me,
Mr. Raynes,&#8221; suggested Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not tell her that you have escaped, when she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
is fretting about you every day of her life! That
would be too bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell her as much as you please without
informing her that you have seen me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not tell a lie, Allan. It would choke
me,&#8221; said the old man solemnly. &#8220;You must go
with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me get another uniform, and it would surprise
her when I come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No more words, young man. You must go. It
is only a short distance,&#8221; replied Mr. Raynes, passing
his arm through that of Somers, and walking
towards his house. &#8220;It will be the happiest day
for Sue which she has seen for a year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Happier for her than it will be for me,&#8221;
thought Somers, who was disposed to break away
from the old man, and make his escape.
</p>
<p>By this time, Sue had become an awful bugbear
to the poor fellow. In these days of photographs,
it is more than probable that she had a picture of
the original Allan Garland, and the cheat would be
discovered the moment he showed his face. He
was deliberating a plan for breaking away from
his persistent friend, when a young lady of eighteen
stepped out from the bushes by the roadside,
and hailed the old man.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE VIRGINIA MAIDEN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been, father?&#8221; said the
young lady in a very sweet and gentle tone, which,
however, sounded like the knell of doom to poor
Somers. &#8220;I have been waiting for you half an
hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But then, perceiving a stranger with her father,
she drew back, abashed at her own forwardness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, Sue,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;Come
here; I want to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She advanced timidly from the bushes where
she had been partially concealed from the gaze of
the passers-by. She was certainly a very pleasant
and comely-looking maiden; but, if she had been
the &#8220;Witch of Endor,&#8221; she could not have been
any more disagreeable to Somers. He was as
fond of adventure as any young man; and if he
could have forgotten that poor Owen Raynes, the
son and the brother, was at that moment lying in
the mud of the swamp; his manly form no more to
gladden the hearts of those who stood before him;
his voice hushed in death, no more to utter the
accents of affection to the devoted father and his
loving sister&mdash;if he could have forgotten his relations
with the dead Owen, he might even have
enjoyed the exciting situation in which he was
placed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>Sue, with a blushing face and half-averted gaze,
stepped out into the road, and stole a few timid
glances at the young lieutenant. It was quite
evident that she did not have a suspicion of the
identity of the young soldier before her. Her
father appeared to have a vein of romance in his
character, and was disposed to torture her for a
time with the torments of suspense, before he declared
to her the astounding truth, that the young
soldier was her well-known but hitherto unseen
friend from Alabama, the bosom companion of her
brother Owen, and, if everything worked as the
loving conspirators intended, the future husband
of the affectionate maiden.
</p>
<p>She did not like to ask who the stranger was;
and she thought it was very provoking of her
father not to tell her, when she was so fearfully
embarrassed by her position. She continued to
blush; and Somers felt so awkward, that he
couldn&#8217;t help joining her in this interesting display
of roses on the cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know him, Sue?&#8221; demanded the
farmer, when he had tantalized her as long as the
circumstances would warrant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course I don&#8217;t, father!&#8221; stammered
the Virginia maiden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look in his face, and see if you can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; persisted
Mr. Raynes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How absurd, father!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absurd, child? Not at all absurd! Haven&#8217;t
you his picture in the house? And, if I mistake
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
not, you have looked at it as many as three times a
day for the last year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, father, you are too bad! I haven&#8217;t done
anything of the sort,&#8221; protested Sue, pouting and
twisting her shoulders as any country girl, who
had not been trained in a satinwood seminary,
would have done under such trying circumstances.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that is Allan Garland?&#8221;
added she, her pretty face lighting up with an expression
of intense satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do, Sue,&#8221; replied Mr. Raynes with emphasis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Allan! I am so glad to see you! I was
afraid I should never see you!&#8221; exclaimed Sue,
rushing up to the young man, and extending both
her hands, which he felt compelled to accept.
</p>
<p>He was fearful that she would kiss him; and,
though he would have been under obligations to
submit to the infliction, he was not sure that the
operation would not cause him to faint. Fortunately
for him, Sue was reasonable in her behavior;
and he escaped cheaper than he expected, when he
beheld the impetuous charge which the maiden
made upon him. If he had really been Allan Garland,
his reception would have been entirely proper,
and highly creditable to the affectionate nature of
the Virginia damsel. He was not the young gentleman
from Alabama; and he felt as though he had
been flanked on both sides, with no chance to beat
off the enemy in front, or to run away in the rear.
He was only a short distance from a line of rebel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
sentinels, and he did not consider it prudent to
escape by taking to his legs. He did not wear his
fighting socks at this time, and felt that it would
be no disgrace to run away from such an enemy as
that which confronted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to see you, Allan,&#8221; repeated
Sue, as the wretched young man did not venture
to use his tongue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, thank you, Miss Raynes!&#8221; said he
at last, when silence seemed even more dangerous
than speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Raynes! Dear me, Allan, how very formal
and precise you are! You called me Sue in
your letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I? Well, I didn&#8217;t know it,&#8221; replied
Somers with a stroke of candor not to be expected
under the circumstances.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly you did. I don&#8217;t think you ever mentioned
such a person as Miss Raynes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am confident I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; added he with another
touch of candor. &#8220;But I will always call you Sue
hereafter, when I have occasion to speak to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Allan! You begin to sound a little
like yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers was very glad to hear it, but wished he
had been five miles off, even if it had been in the
very jaws of the Fourth Alabama.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look a bit like your photograph,&#8221;
continued Sue, gazing with admiration at the face
of the young man; for which those who ever saw
Lieutenant Somers will cheerfully pardon her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very strange. Everybody who has seen
my photograph says it looks exactly like me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave one to a young lady of my acquaintance,
who said it was perfect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! Who was she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a young lady whom I have met only two
or three times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is her name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lilian Ashford.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pretty name!&#8221; said Sue, endeavoring
to be magnanimous; though it was evident that she
was troubled by the honest avowal of the young
soldier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does she live?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is at the North, now,&#8221; answered Somers,
who could not bear to tell a lie when there was no
need of such a sacrifice.
</p>
<p>He was becoming very uneasy under this rigid
catechizing, and hoped she would not ask any more
questions about Lilian Ashford. He had mentioned
her name with the hope that it might produce
a coldness on her part which would afford
him some advantage. She did not, however, seem
to be annihilated by the prospect of a rival, and
was proceeding to interrogate him still further in
regard to the lady, with whom he was apparently
intimate enough to present her his photograph,
when Mr. Raynes reminded her that they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
standing in the road, and had better go into the
house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Raynes, as I have seen Sue, and Sue
has seen me, I think I had better hasten to my
regiment,&#8221; suggested Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, Allan,&#8221; replied the old man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish to run away, and leave me so
soon, you monster?&#8221; added Sue. &#8220;I tell you, sir,
I shall not let you go yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Sue! you forget that I have just returned
from the Yankees. I was furnished with a pass,
to enable me to find my regiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall find it in good time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to the house, Allan: we will not detain
you long,&#8221; added Mr. Raynes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must and shall come!&#8221; protested Sue,
taking him by the arm, and absolutely compelling
him to go, or be guilty of the most unpardonable
rudeness to the fair Virginia damsel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very glad to go with you, Sue, if
my duty did not call me elsewhere. I am to be
sent off on very important service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Again?&mdash;so soon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This very day. I may never see you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you would coolly run away and leave me
without even going into the house!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But my duty, Sue!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be in time for your duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be arrested as a deserter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You have a pass in your pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In spite of the pass, if your father had not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
happened to see me, I should have been arrested,
and might have spent a day or two in the guardhouse
before the case could have been explained.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No more argument, Allan,&#8221; said the persevering
girl. &#8220;Here is the house; you shall go in and
look at mother, if you don&#8217;t stop but a minute.
Besides, I want to see your photograph while you
are present; for I am sure you don&#8217;t look any more
like the picture than the picture does like you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably not,&#8221; replied Somers, as the resolute
maiden dragged him into the house; where, without
stopping to breathe, she presented him to her
mother, with the astounding declaration, that he
was Allan Garland.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Raynes gave him a cordial Virginia welcome;
and, while he was endeavoring to make
himself as agreeable as possible to the old lady,
Sue rushed up-stairs to procure the faithless photograph.
She returned in a moment with the picture
in her hand, and proceeded at once to institute
a comparison between the shadow and the
substance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, stand up here, sir, and let me see,&#8221; said
she, as she playfully whisked him round and scrutinized
his features. &#8220;I told you it did not look
like you; and I am very sure now that it does not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; added Somers, extending his hand
for the picture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you promise to give it back to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I will! You don&#8217;t imagine I would
be so mean as to confiscate it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I should not care much if you did, now that
I have found out it does not look any more like
you than it does like me,&#8221; she answered, handing
him the photograph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get this picture, Sue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did I get it? Well, that is cool! Didn&#8217;t
you send it to me yourself?&#8221; And Sue began to
exhibit some symptoms of amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sure I never sent you this picture,&#8221;
added Somers gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Allan Garland!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not my picture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thereupon Mr. Raynes began to laugh in the
most immoderate manner; opening his mouth wide
enough to take in a very small load of hay, and
shaking his sides in the most extraordinary style.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at, pa?&#8221; demanded
Sue, blushing up to the eyes, as though she already
felt the force of some keenly satirical remark
which was struggling for expression in the mouth
of the farmer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To think you have been looking at that picture
three times a day for a year, studying, gazing
at it; kissing it, for aught I know; and then to
find out that it is not Allan after all!&#8221; roared the
Virginia farmer between the outbreaks of his
mirth. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done anything but groan since
the war began, and it does me good to laugh. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
haven&#8217;t had a jolly time before since the battle of
Bull Run, as the Yankees call it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the most absurd pa in Virginia. I
didn&#8217;t look at it three times a day, I never studied
it, and I&#8217;m sure I never kissed it. No wonder Allan
wants to get away, when he finds what an absurd
girl you make me out to be. You think I&#8217;m
a fool, don&#8217;t you, Allan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not, by any means. I&#8217;m sure, if I had your
picture, I shouldn&#8217;t have been ashamed to look at
it three times a day,&#8221; replied Somers, gallantly
coming to the rescue of the maiden. &#8220;But, really,
my Virginia patriarch,&#8221; he added, using an expression
which he had found in the correspondence in
his pocket, &#8220;I must tear myself away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be glad enough to go,&#8221; pouted
Sue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to go, but compelled by the duty I owe
my country to leave you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When will you come again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, that question I cannot answer. I
may never see you again. This is a terrible war,
and we cannot tell what a day may bring forth,&#8221;
replied Somers solemnly; and the thought was all
the more solemn when he thought of the cold
corpse of the son and brother concealed in the mire
of the swamp.
</p>
<p>He had seen the old man laugh as none but a
happy man can; and he could not help feeling what
a terrible revulsion a few words from him might
cause. He had watched the playful manner of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Sue, and had joined in the gay raillery of the moment.
A word from him would crush her spirit,
and bow that loving mother to the ground. The
scene had not been one of his own choosing; and
he would gladly escape the necessity of dissembling
before those affectionate hearts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on the eve of a terrible battle,&#8221; added
the old man very gravely. &#8220;Hundreds of our poor
boys went down yesterday, never to rise again.
We tremble when we think of you in the field. I
may never see my son again; for the issue of the
war may depend on the battles of the next few
days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Raynes seemed to know more than he had
dared to speak; and Somers was full of interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Yankees, who expect to go into Richmond,
will be driven down the Peninsula, where they
came up, like flying sheep, within a week. I have
heard a few words, which satisfies me that great
events are coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Though it was not supposable that the people
in the vicinity of Richmond knew the plans of
General Lee, from what he had seen, and from
what he had heard from men in power, he had
formed a very correct idea of the intended operations
of the rebel chief; and he stated his views
very clearly to Somers. While he was listening
to the old man&#8217;s theory, Mrs. Raynes had spread
her table, and placed upon it such food as was
available for a hasty lunch. She insisted that he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
should partake; and, while he enjoyed the welcome
refreshment, Mr. Raynes told him everything
about the movements of the Confederate army in
the vicinity, with full particulars of the battle of
the preceding day. While the scout was thus answering
the ends of his mission, he was in no hurry
to depart.
</p>
<p>General McClellan&#8217;s &#8220;change of base&#8221; was not
suspected by the rebels at this time. It was their
purpose to flank the Union army on the right and
left, and destroy it effectually. The dispositions
had been made for this purpose; and, as Mr.
Raynes was a man of influence and intelligence,
his information was as reliable as could be deduced
from the preliminary movements of the rebel army.
He was confident of success. The execution of the
plan had already been commenced, and the right
of the Union line was in the act of falling back.
</p>
<p>He expatiated upon the perils of the campaign,
and the terrible fighting which was to be expected;
and manifested the utmost solicitude for the safety
of his son, and hardly less for his guest.
</p>
<p>Somers prolonged his repast, that the old man
might leave nothing unsaid that would be important
for the Union generals to know. Sue occasionally
joined in the conversation; but she was quite
serious now, as she contemplated the perils to
which her brother and her friend from Alabama
must be subjected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where General Jackson is now?&#8221;
asked Somers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly where he is; but I know
what part he has to play in the great drama. The
last we heard of him was, that he was watching
McDowell, near Fredericksburg. If McDowell
keeps quiet, Jackson will rush down on the left
flank of the Yankees, and cut off their retreat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sure. I can tell you why.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before he had time to tell him why, a knock at
the door disturbed the conference; and a young
man, in a tattered rebel uniform, was ushered into
the room.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE DIGNIFIED YOUNG REBEL</h3>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant Somers, who had been very nervous
and uneasy before, was exceedingly annoyed
by the appearance of another actor on the stage.
He had become in some slight degree familiarized
with the awkwardness of his situation; for the fact,
that no suspicion had yet been cast upon his
identity, was encouraging, and he began to have
some confidence in his position, open as it was to an
assault from any direction. The advent of the
tattered stranger was a new cause for alarm, and
he at once became very anxious to beat a retreat.
</p>
<p>There is no night without some ray of light to
gladden it. His first impression was that the visitor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
belonged to the Fourth Alabama, and would
readily recognize him as an impostor; but he was
in a measure relieved to find that none of the
family gave the soldier more than a friendly greeting,
which proved him to be a stranger to them as
well as to himself. Yet he might belong to the
Fourth Alabama; and then it occurred to him that
the man had come to inform Mr. Raynes of the
death of his son while on picket duty.
</p>
<p>In the brief period which elapsed between the
advent of the stranger, and the statement of the
object of his visit, Somers was disturbed by a dozen
fearful theories; all of which seemed to end in a
rebel prison at Richmond, and even in a rebel gallows&mdash;the
fate of the spy. The minutes were
fearfully long; and, before the momentous question
of the object of the stranger&#8217;s visit could be introduced,
he decided to make an abrupt retreat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Raynes,&#8221; said he, approaching the
old man as he put on his cap, &#8220;I have already run
a great risk in stopping here so long; and, with
many thanks to you for your kindness and for your
generous hospitality, I must take my departure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we cannot keep you any longer, Allan;
but you must promise to call again at the first
convenient opportunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise you that I will the first time I can
safely do so,&#8221; responded Somers warmly, and with
the fullest intention of redeeming his promise.
&#8220;Good-by, sir!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, my dear boy! May you be spared in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the hour when the strong men bite the dust!&#8221; said
Mr. Raynes solemnly, as he gave his hand to
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Sue!&#8221; added the young lieutenant,
taking the hand of the Virginia damsel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Adieu, my brave soldier-boy!&#8221; she replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a soldier, I see,&#8221; said the stranger, as
Somers approached him on his way out of the
house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered the latter nervously; for
he would gladly have escaped any communication
with the newcomer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What regiment do you belong to?&#8221; persisted
the dilapidated soldier.
</p>
<p>What business was that to him? Why should
he trouble himself about other people&#8217;s affairs?
It sounded like a very impertinent question to the
excited lieutenant, and he was tempted to inform
the busy-body that it was none of his business;
but, as he had already earned a good character for
civility with the interesting family in whose presence
he still stood, his bump of approbation would
not permit him to forfeit their esteem by so inconsiderate
a reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, all!&#8221; said he with energy, turning
away from the rebel soldier, and moving towards
the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What regiment did you say you belonged to?&#8221;
demanded the persistent rebel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say,&#8221; replied Somers, not in the most
gentle tones.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you oblige me by telling me to what regiment
you belong?&#8221; added the rebel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I will not,&#8221; continued Somers, more
and more displeased with the persistence of the
other. &#8220;I came very near being arrested as a deserter
just now, though I have a pass in my pocket;
and I don&#8217;t care about exposing myself to any further
annoyance by my own indiscretion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you I am a friend, and I would not
betray you if I knew you were a deserter,&#8221; said the
stranger in very civil tones.
</p>
<p>Thus appealed to, and perceiving that he was
not gaining in the estimation of Mr. Raynes by
his reticence, he decided that he could not make
the matter much worse by answering the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Fourth Alabama,&#8221; he replied desperately;
&#8220;but you must excuse me; for I am in a tremendous
hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fourth Alabama! I thought so,&#8221; exclaimed
the stranger with a pleasant smile, as
though the information was particularly agreeable
to him. &#8220;I belong to the Fourth Alabama
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you, indeed?&#8221; added Somers with the most
intense disquiet, wishing all the time that the soldier
had been in Alabama, or anywhere but in the
house of Mr. Raynes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me where the regiment is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot. I have been looking for it myself
for the last two hours. As I can be of no assistance
to you, you will excuse me if I leave you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast, comrade; I will go with you. I
have some directions which I think will enable us
to find the regiment; and, if you please, I will bear
you company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers did not please; but he could hardly refuse
the offer without exciting the suspicion of the
family, which he felt might be fatal to him. It
would be better to depart with the member of the
Fourth Alabama, and part company with him by
force of stratagem when they had left the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t keep you waiting but a minute. I
called here to see my friends; but none of them
seem to know me. You are Mr. Raynes, I presume?&#8221;
continued the soldier, addressing the old
man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am; but I don&#8217;t remember to have ever seen
you before,&#8221; replied the farmer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never did, sir; but I will venture to say
that my name is well known in this house,&#8221; added
the soldier with a mysterious smile, which caused
Somers to dread some new development that would
compromise him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Mr. Raynes, ever ready to welcome
any one who had the slightest claim upon his hospitality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am well acquainted with your son, Owen;
I suppose I shall not be disputed here, when I say
that he is the best fellow in the world. Don&#8217;t you
know me now?&#8221; demanded the tantalizing rebel,
who appeared to be very anxious to have his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
identity made out in the natural way, and without
any troublesome explanations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, I do not,&#8221; answered Mr. Raynes, much
perplexed by the confident manner of the visitor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Sue, I suppose?&#8221; pursued the soldier,
advancing to the maiden, and extending his dirty
hand; which, however, was not much dirtier than
that which she had so eagerly grasped before.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know who I am, Sue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not, sir,&#8221; she replied rather coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I tell you that I belong to the Fourth
Alabama, don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when I tell you that I am the intimate
friend of your brother Owen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Allan Garland stood by the door; and, of course,
it was not he; therefore she could not, by any possibility,
conceive who he was; and she said so, in
terms as explicit as the occasion required.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I live in Union, Alabama, when I am at home.
Don&#8217;t you know me <i>now</i>, Sue?&#8221; persisted the perplexed
visitor, who, perhaps, began to think he had
entered the wrong house.
</p>
<p>If the veritable Allan Garland, however little
his photograph resembled him, had not stood by
the door, she would have been rejoiced to see him,
and to recognize in him her unknown friend and
correspondent. As it was, she did not know him;
and she was candid enough to express her conviction
without reserve, in spite of the disagreeable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
effect which her want of perception seemed to produce
upon the mind of the stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very strange,&#8221; said the soldier, taking
off his cap, and rubbing his head to quicken his
faculties, which seemed to have led him into some
unaccountable blunder. &#8220;Will you be kind enough
to inform me who lives in this house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Raynes,&#8221; replied Sue, quite as much mystified
as the stranger seemed to be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is some mistake; but I can&#8217;t make out
what it is,&#8221; said the stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot wait any longer,&#8221; said Somers, who
had been riveted to the spot by the astounding
revelation to which he had just listened.
</p>
<p>He had been almost paralyzed by the words of
the rebel, in whom he promptly recognized the
young man whose name and antecedents he had
borrowed for the present occasion. His first impression
was to take to his heels, and to run away;
but a certain worldly prudence prevented him from
adopting this doubtful policy. If you attempt to
run away from an angry dog, he will certainly bite
you; whereas, by facing him boldly, you may escape
all injury. This fact, which Somers had fully exemplified
in his own experience before he left
Pinchbrook, was the foundation of his action. Seeing
that the stranger was perplexed and annoyed
by the failure of the family to recognize him, even
after he had told them everything except his name,
he decided that he might safely retire under the
plea of haste.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir, for this intrusion,&#8221; said
the soldier, blushing with mortification as he retreated
a pace towards the door. &#8220;You will excuse
me, Miss Raynes, for my unwarrantable
familiarity; but I have made a blunder, or you
have,&#8221; he added rather bitterly. &#8220;Perhaps, when
Owen comes to introduce me, you will know me
better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Owen&#8217;s friends are my friends, young man;
and you are as welcome as my son would be, whoever
you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir; but, with many regrets for this
intrusion, I will take my leave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, my young friend,&#8221; interposed the old
man. &#8220;You must not leave us in this manner. It
is true, we do not recognize you; but you are none
the less welcome on that account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you kindly, sir. I have deceived myself
into the belief that I was better known here
than I find I am. It was weak in me to thrust
myself across your threshold without an introduction;
and, if you will pardon me, I will leave you,
with the promise to come again with Owen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, sir; at least, not till you have told
us who you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me; but I must go now,&#8221; replied the
young rebel with an exhibition of gentle dignity,
which quite won the heart of Somers, as it did that
of the family.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray, give me your name, sir,&#8221; interposed Sue,
whose woman&#8217;s curiosity could no longer endure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
the silence which maidenly reserve had imposed
upon her, especially as the stranger proposed to
depart without solving the mystery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll excuse me, Miss Raynes, if I decline for
the present. My comrade is in a desperate hurry,
and it is not reasonable for me to detain him any
longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, young man, you wrong me, you wrong
my daughter, and above all, you wrong my son,
who is your friend, by leaving in this manner,&#8221;
said Mr. Raynes earnestly. &#8220;You actually charge
us with a want of hospitality by this abrupt withdrawal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will pardon me, sir, for saying it; but
after the description I have given of myself, if you
do not know me, I am compelled to believe that
it is because you do not wish to know me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very unjust, and we do not comprehend
the force of the remark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sir, I have written to you, and to your
daughter, and your daughter has written to me;
and now you seem never to have heard of me. I
have told you that I reside in Union, Alabama;
and that I am a friend of Owen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know a young man from that town very
well, though we never saw him. His name is Allan
Garland; but it is impossible that you should
be the person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go, comrade,&#8221; said Somers desperately,
as he rushed out of the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Raynes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
grasping him by the arm; for the old farmer
seemed to think his presence was necessary to the
perfect unraveling of the mystery. &#8220;It seems to
me you ought to know this young man, if none of
us do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not, Mr. Raynes; never saw him before in
my life,&#8221; protested Somers, feeling very much like
a condemned criminal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Allan Garland,&#8221; quietly continued
the dignified young rebel. &#8220;I am, undoubtedly,
the person to whom you allude.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Raynes, still holding
Somers&#8217;s arm with the grasp of a vise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; almost shouted the fair Sue, more
excited than she would have been, if, through
patient reading, she had arrived at the last chapter
of a sensational novel, where the pin is pulled out
and all the villains tumble down to perdition and
all the angels stumble upon their apotheosis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; chimed in Mrs. Raynes, who had
preserved a most remarkable silence, for a woman,
during the exciting incidents we have transcribed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I be allowed to inquire why you think
it is impossible?&#8221; calmly demanded the gentle
rebel, who, in his turn, was amazed at the singular
course of events.
</p>
<p>Sue did not know what else to do; so she sat
down in a chair, and laughed with hysterical
vehemence at the strange aspect of the affair. The
old man opened his eyes, and opened his mouth;
but he did not forget to hold on with all his might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
to the arm of the unfortunate lieutenant, who was
just then picturing to himself the interior of a
rebel dungeon; which view suddenly dissolved into
an indistinct representation of a tree, from a stout
limb of which was suspended a rope, hanging down
over a cart&mdash;these latter appurtenances being
symbolical of the usual rebel method of hanging a
spy.
</p>
<p>The affair, which had been growing desperate
for some time, had now actually become so to poor
Somers. He placed his hand upon his revolver,
in the breast-pocket of his coat; but some prudential
considerations interposed to prevent him from
using it. The house was on a line of rebel sentinels.
Whole divisions of Confederate infantry,
artillery and cavalry, were encamped around him,
and any violent movement on his part would have
been sure to result in an ignominious disaster.
The doughty old farmer, who was not less than
six feet three in his stockinged feet, held on to him
as a drowning man clings to a floating spar. It
was not possible to get away without resorting to
violence; and if he offered any resistance to what,
just then, looked like manifest destiny, the rebel
soldier would become an ally of the farmer, and
the women could call in the sentinels, if nothing
more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Raynes, you are very unkind to
detain me, when I tell you that my leave has
nearly expired,&#8221; said Somers, when he had fully
measured the situation; which, however, was done
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
in a tithe of the time which we have taken to
transcribe it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man, there is some <i>mistake</i>,&#8221; said Mr.
Raynes, placing a wicked emphasis on the word,
which went to the very core of the scout&#8217;s heart.
&#8220;This man says he is Allan Garland, and you say
you are Allan Garland. One of you is an impostor.
Neither of you shall go till we determine
which is the one. Sue, bring out your photograph
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; gasped Somers, as in a fit of momentary
despondency, he gave himself up for lost,
when the maiden went for the picture.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL</h3>
</div>

<p>Miss Sue hastened to procure the photograph,
which she had placed in her mother&#8217;s room after
it had been fully discussed by herself and the supposed
original. At the same time, her father conducted
Somers into the room again; and, being
fully conscious of his desire to get away, he kept
a watchful eye upon him, though he removed his
grasp from the arm. The rebel soldier looked on
in utter amazement at the singular proceedings of
all the party, and seemed utterly unable to comprehend
the meaning of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here is the picture,&#8221; said Sue, returning with
the photograph in her hand; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see that
it looks any more like you than it does like the
other gentleman;&#8221; and she proceeded to institute
a comparison between the new claimant and the
picture.
</p>
<p>Somers began to cherish a faint hope again, and
to be very grateful for the general truth, that
photographs do not always look like the originals.
This encouragement, slight as it was, gave our hero
a new inspiration, and in a measure restored his
impudence; which, under the pressure of circumstances,
had begun to give way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure it does not look at all like you,&#8221; continued
Sue, after she had patiently balanced all the
points of resemblance, and all the points of disagreement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should remember that the picture was
taken more than a year ago; and that I have been
an invalid for ten months of the time,&#8221; suggested
the rebel soldier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be; but I am sure this picture could
never have been taken for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see it, if you please?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sue handed him the card, and he glanced at it
with an expression of great curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get this picture?&#8221; demanded he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was sent to me by the original,&#8221; replied she.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not my picture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what the other gentleman said;
and I am perfectly willing to believe both of you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I sent you a picture of myself, though this
is not the one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is very singular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will remember, there were two in the
same letter; the other was a young man whom
Owen was acquainted with, and who desired something
to remember him by. He is in a Mississippi
regiment now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! what a blunder!&#8221; exclaimed Sue,
laughing heartily. &#8220;I am sure I took the best looking
of the two for Allan Garland&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps that is not very complimentary to me;
but where is the other picture?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I put it in Owen&#8217;s room. I told him what I
had done with the two pictures; but he has been
at home so little, that I suppose he never looked
at them. I will get the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are beginning to get a little light on the
subject,&#8221; said Mr. Raynes, when his daughter had
left the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think you will let a little light through
my body with a bullet-hole,&#8221; added Somers, whose
last hope was gone again, though his impudence
still remained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be patient, young man; we shall soon see the
mystery explained, and be able to inform you
whether you are Allan Garland or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to put you to so much trouble, Mr.
Raynes; but you will remember that I was very
much opposed to coming into your house at all;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
that I was literally dragged in by yourself and
your daughter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will also remember that I saved you
from arrest, when you gave your name as Allan
Garland, of the Fourth Alabama. I think I have
imparted to you some very valuable information;
and I intend to see what use is to be made of it,
before I take my eyes off you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very affectionate, Mr. Raynes; and, in
behalf of the great Southern Confederacy, I thank
you for the zeal and loyalty which you have displayed,&#8221;
replied Somers boldly; for it was plain
that nothing but the most brazen impudence could
save him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a bold youth, and it is plain that you
have brilliant talents; I hope they have not been
abused.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have been, and will continue to be, used
in the service of my suffering country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like you, and I hope everything is all right
about you; but I cannot see your object in coming
here under an assumed name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have decided the case against me&mdash;have
you?&#8221; said Somers, glancing at the rival
Allan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I was a little too fast,&#8221; added the old
man, mortified to find that his character for strict
justice had been compromised by this hasty avowal.
</p>
<p>Sue was absent a long time; and it was clear
that the photograph had been mislaid. Somers
was in hopes she would not be able to find it;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
though he had but a meager expectation of over-throwing
the claims of his rival to the name of
Allan Garland. It was a hot day, and the windows
of the house were all open. His legs seemed to
promise the only satisfactory solution of the problem;
and while he was considering the propriety of
jumping out through one of the open windows, and
trusting to them for safety, Sue returned with the
photograph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks more like you than the other; and
more like you than it does like the other gentleman,&#8221;
said Sue.
</p>
<p>The rebel soldier took the card, and acknowledged
that it was his photograph; at the same time,
he was compelled to allow that it was but an indifferent
likeness of himself. His hard service in
the army had changed his appearance much. Sue
gazed at the picture, and at the original, and her
father did the same; but both of them were in
doubt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, sir! I have waited patiently for you
to end this farce,&#8221; said Somers, in deep disgust
apparently. &#8220;You have looked at the pictures,
and you are not satisfied yet. I can stand it no
longer; I am tired of the whole thing. You have
treated me very handsomely, and I am grateful to
you for your kindness to me; but I cannot and will
not remain any longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers spoke decidedly, and was fully resolved
to use his pistol, if occasion required. He was not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
willing to remain for a decision to be made between
him and the other claimant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go with you, brother Allan Garland,&#8221;
said the rebel soldier facetiously; &#8220;I think between
us we can readily decide which is the right man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we desire to be satisfied, especially in regard
to this young man, who was suspected of
being a deserter, and for whom I feel that I am
responsible,&#8221; said Mr. Raynes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do nothing for you, sir,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can do something for you; and I propose
to take you to the sergeant where I found you, and
let the military authorities decide,&#8221; continued the
old man, whose ire was roused, as he moved towards
the impudent young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I propose that you shall do nothing of the
kind,&#8221; answered Somers, drawing the pistol, and
cocking it for use.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, father, don&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Sue, rushing
between Mr. Raynes and the active youth, pale
with terror.
</p>
<p>Somers would have been very unwilling to use
his weapon on the old man. He pitied him, and
could not help thinking of the terrible blow which
was in store for him when he should hear that his
only son had been killed. He hoped that something
would interpose to prevent any violence, and
he expected much from the gentle dignity of the
young rebel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry that you compel me to draw this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
pistol,&#8221; added Somers; &#8220;yet nothing but the duty
I owe to myself and my country would permit me
to use it upon those who have treated me so
kindly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be responsible for him,&#8221; said Allan Garland&mdash;the
real one; for there could be no doubt
that he was what he claimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not go near him, father! He will
kill you!&#8221; cried Sue, terrified, as her father attempted
to push her aside, and advance upon the
armed young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come! brother Allan,&#8221; said the soldier: &#8220;we
can best end this scene by leaving the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they approached the door, a hand was placed
on the handle outside; but the old man had taken
the precaution to fasten it, in order to insure the
safety of his prisoner. A heavy knock succeeded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; gasped Sue, afraid that any
newcomer would only complicate the difficulties of
the moment, and that the bold youth would be
compelled to use his pistol.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is Owen,&#8221; replied the old man, a
little calmer than before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The words sent a shudder through the frame
of Somers, as he again thought of Owen Raynes,
cold and dead in his oozy grave in the swamp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Open the door,&#8221; said a voice from without.
</p>
<p>Allan Garland drew the bolt, and threw the door
wide open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Allan, my dear fellow!&#8221; exclaimed a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
young man who stood at the outside of the door
in his shirt sleeves, as he grasped both of the rebel
soldier&#8217;s hands, and proceeded to make a most
extravagant demonstration of rejoicing. &#8220;I am
glad to see you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Owen, my dear boy!&#8221; replied Allan Garland,
as he returned with equal warmth the salutation
of the newcomer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from, Allan? I had
given you up for lost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I escaped from the Yankees the next day after
I was taken, and have been beating about the
woods ever since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers was thrown all aback by this arrival,
which was certainly the most remarkable one that
had taken place during the day. He couldn&#8217;t help
feeling very much like the hero of a sensational
novel; and realized the very original idea that
truth is stranger than fiction. He could not exactly
account for the presence of Owen Raynes,
whom he had satisfactorily buried in the swamp,
and whose clothes he had the honor to wear at that
moment. He did not believe in things supernatural,
and it never occurred to him that the form
before him might be the ghost of Owen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you have come just as you did,
Owen,&#8221; said Mr. Raynes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I; otherwise I might not have met Allan.
But who is this?&#8221; he added, glancing at
Somers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your most obedient servant,&#8221; replied Somers,
trying to pass him in the narrow entry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, young man!&#8221; shouted the old man.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him go, Owen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Allan Garland, of Union, Alabama;
and he is a private in the Fourth Alabama,&#8221;
replied Allan with a smile, as Owen placed himself
between Somers and the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Raynes, being the oldest man present, was
entitled to the position of spokesman; and he made
a very prolix statement of all the events which had
transpired since he first saw the pretended Allan
Garland.
</p>
<p>Owen Raynes was a very good-natured young
man, and the recital of the affair amused him exceedingly.
He did not fly into a passion, being a
very amiable and reasonable rebel; and seemed to
regard the whole thing as a stupendous joke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your name is Allan Garland, is it?&#8221; demanded
he, with a broad laugh still playing on his
lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my name at present,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But have you no other name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None worth mentioning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! To what regiment do you belong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Fourth Alabama, Colonel Jones; but
I have already told your respected father all the
facts relating to myself, and some relating to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, is this a joke, a sell?&#8221; demanded Owen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that would be a very proper interpretation
to put upon it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be a good fellow, and deal in
four-syllable words.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, as you seem to have the best of the joke,
I hope you will not detain me any longer. I have
a pass in my pocket to prove that I am all right;
and, as I am in a great hurry, I must move on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till you explain the joke. Eh? What&#8217;s
this? Where did you get this coat?&#8221; said Owen,
glancing at the garment which Somers wore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the key to the joke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The key to it! I am of the opinion that this
is my coat,&#8221; replied Owen, as he felt of the garment,
and turned up the lapel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I be allowed to inquire where you left
your coat?&#8221; asked Somers, who was quite curious
to know how Owen Raynes happened to be alive
just at that moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly you may; but first let me ask where
you found it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over by the picket-line beyond the hill,&#8221; replied
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. A young fellow in a Mississippi regiment,
encamped next to ours, borrowed it of me
last night, when he was detailed for picket-duty.
The poor fellow had no coat, and picket-duty is
rather steep at night when a man has no clothes.
He is a good fellow, in poor health; and I lent him
mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The nights are cool, but the days are hot,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
added Somers. &#8220;He took it off, and left it on the
edge of the woods, where I found it. I didn&#8217;t know
that it belonged to anybody. I found some papers
and a diary in the pocket&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I leave my papers in the pocket? Well,
that was stupid,&#8221; interrupted Owen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I read the papers with a great deal of interest.
Seeing frequent allusions in them to Allan Garland,
I took the liberty to appropriate the name
myself; for the owner of it seemed to be a very
good fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; said Allan; &#8220;but, as you seem to
have no further use for it, I see no objection to
your giving your own name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, there are some very strong
objections, and I must trouble you for the use of
your name an hour or two longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well! I am satisfied,&#8221; replied Allan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am not,&#8221; interposed Mr. Raynes. &#8220;I
think the fellow is an impostor, if nothing worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything you please; but my time is out, and
I must report for duty,&#8221; replied Somers boldly, as
he took off the borrowed coat, and restored it to
the owner. &#8220;I am very much obliged to you for
the use of this garment. When we meet again, I
trust we shall understand each other better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Owen Raynes was an easy-going young man;
familiar with the practical jokes of the army, enjoying
them with the most keen relish when no
one&#8217;s feelings were hurt, and no damage was done
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
to person or property. He was not, therefore,
disposed to put a serious construction on what
seemed to him to be one of these farces; but his
father took an entirely different view of the affair.
He wanted to argue the question, and show that
it could not be a joke; but Somers was too impatient
to listen to any eloquence of this description.
</p>
<p>Sue, who had now actually found the young
man who had been indicated as her &#8220;manifest
destiny,&#8221; was in no hurry to part with him; and
when the father proposed that Owen and Allan
should accompany the impostor, as he insisted
upon calling him, to the brigade headquarters,
where his pass was dated, she decidedly objected to
the proposition. The earnestness of Mr. Raynes,
however, at last vanquished her and the young
man; and they started to escort our young lieutenant
to the place indicated.
</p>
<p>Now, Somers, being a modest man, as we have
always held him up to our readers, and being
averse to all the pomp and parade of martial glory
in its application to himself, was strongly averse
to an escort. He preferred to go alone, tell his
own story, and fight his own battles, if battles
there were to be fought. Owen and Allan were
unutterably affectionate. They received him into
their small circle of fellowship, and stuck to him
like a brother. They were both good fellows,
splendid fellows; and, under ordinary circumstances,
Somers would have been delighted to cultivate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
their friendship. As it was, he ungratefully
resolved to give them the slip at the first convenient
opportunity.
</p>
<p>Unhappily for him, no opportunity occurred,
for his zealous friends would not permit him to go
a single rod from them; and Somers had about
made up his mind to trust the matter to the judgment
of Major Platner, who had shown a remarkable
discrimination during the former interview,
when the trio came to a line of sentinels guarding
a brigade camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What regiment do you belong to?&#8221; demanded
the guard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourth Alabama,&#8221; replied Owen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t pass this line, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have a pass,&#8221; interposed Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Show your pass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers showed the important document, which
the sentinel, after a patient study, succeeded in
deciphering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your pass is right&mdash;pass on; but you can&#8217;t go
through,&#8221; he added to Owen and Allan.
</p>
<p>Owen explained.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE REBEL DIVISION GENERAL</h3>
</div>

<p>The sentinel listened very patiently to the explanation
of Owen Raynes; but, as he proceeded,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
the face of the soldier relaxed till his muscles had
contracted into a broad grin. The sergeant of the
guard was then sent for, and the explanation repeated.
At its conclusion, both the sentinel and
the sergeant seemed to be disposed to laugh in the
faces of the twin friends, so keenly were the former
alive to the ludicrous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very pretty story, my men! You,
without the pass, are going to see that everything
is right about the man that has the pass; in other
words, the devils are going to see that the angels
don&#8217;t do anything wicked,&#8221; said the sergeant,
laughing at the awkward position of Owen and
Allan, and perhaps quite as much at the sharpness
of his own illustration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are entirely satisfied in regard to this
young man,&#8221; said Owen; &#8220;but we have come in
order to satisfy another person, who believes that
he is an impostor. We promised to take him to
Major Platner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t enter these lines without a pass,&#8221;
replied the sergeant firmly. &#8220;This man can go
through; for he has a pass,&#8221; he added to Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As I am all right, and in a hurry, I will proceed
to the brigade headquarters,&#8221; said Somers.
&#8220;Now, good-by, my friends; I am very glad to
have met you, and much obliged to you for the
trouble you have taken to come so far with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You take it coolly,&#8221; laughed Owen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, if you desire to go to the brigade
headquarters, the sergeant will let you pass, if I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
will vouch for you,&#8221; continued Somers with great
good humor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not very particular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say, sergeant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My orders are to permit no stragglers from
other camps to pass these lines, and I shall obey
my orders to the letter,&#8221; replied the official, who,
for some reason or other, seemed to be prejudiced
against Somers&#8217;s friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stragglers!&#8221; exclaimed the sensitive Allan.
&#8220;I think we have gone far enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you have,&#8221; added the sergeant; &#8220;and,
if you don&#8217;t leave at once, it will be my duty to
arrest you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; exclaimed Owen. &#8220;That would be
carrying the joke altogether too far. I think my
<i>pater</i> ought to be satisfied with what we have
done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Move on,&#8221; said the sergeant.
</p>
<p>They did move on; and Somers, attended by the
officer of the guard, walked towards headquarters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are the coolest fellows that ever came
near my lines,&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;Men without
a pass looking out for one who has a pass!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they are good fellows; but I played a
joke upon them, which makes them a little sour
towards me,&#8221; replied the scout. &#8220;I am even with
them now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the joke?&#8221; demanded the sergeant,
who was filled with interest at the mention of
the word.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>Somers gave him a modified account of the affair
at the house of Mr. Raynes; which he embellished
a little for the occasion, to allay any suspicion
which might arise in the mind of the auditor. But
the officer of the guard had no suspicion. Why
should he have any? for Somers, armed with a pass
signed by the officer of the day, was walking as
directly as he could towards the headquarters.
The sergeant of the guard left him when they
reached the guard tent; and Somers proceeded to
report in due form to the major, whom he found
smoking his cigar under a tree as complacently as
though there was not a traitor or a spy in the land.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, young man! you have returned promptly
at the time specified,&#8221; said the major, as Somers
very deferentially touched his cap to this magnate
of the rebel army.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I have endeavored to discharge my
duty faithfully,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you find the regiment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I lost my way; and finding I should
not have time to go to the place where it is, without
overstaying my time, I hastened back, knowing
that the service upon which you wished to employ
me was very important indeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did right, young man. Where is your
coat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one I picked up just after I had passed
the lines, and a soldier down below claimed it. I
gave it up when he convinced me it was his
property.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are very honest as well as patriotic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers bowed, but made no reply to the compliment;
which, however, was fully appreciated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be a young man of good address,
and you can render your country a great service,
but it will be at the peril of your life,&#8221; said the
major with impressive formality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to serve my country, even with
my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not doubt it. I was impressed by your
manner, and I have recommended you to the general
for the service he has in view. I hope you
will do credit to the selection I have made; for
the most important duty which a commander has
to perform is to select proper persons for the execution
of special missions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will endeavor to serve my country to the best
of my ability; and I am satisfied that I can go all
over the Yankee camps without difficulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well! You have confidence in yourself;
and that is the first requisite of success. If you
discharge this duty with fidelity and skill, you
may be sure of being made a sergeant the moment
you return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Major Platner. I am very grateful
to you, sir, for the opportunity you thus afford
me to distinguish myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find me a good friend, if you are
faithful and intelligent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you shall go with me to General M&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
headquarters, and he will give you your final instructions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Major Platner led the way; and Somers reverently
followed a pace or two behind him, flattering
the officer in every action as well as word.
They reached the division headquarters, and our
hero was ushered into the presence of the general.
He was a large, red-faced man, and had evidently
taken all the whiskey he could carry, at his dinner,
from which he had just returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you got there, Platner?&#8221; demanded
the general, in a tone so rough, that Somers was
reminded of the ogre in Jack the Giant-killer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The young man of whom I spoke to you this
forenoon. He is a person of remarkable address,
courage and skill; and is just the man you need.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; adieu, major!&#8221; added the general,
bowing to the other.
</p>
<p>Major Platner took the hint, and took himself
off, leaving Somers standing alone and somewhat
abashed in the presence of the great man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man!&#8221; said, or rather roared, the rebel
general, as he raised his eyes from the ground,
and fixed them with a half-drunken leer upon our
hero.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much whiskey can you drink without
going by the board?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers did not know, had never tried the experiment,
and was utterly opposed to all such
practices. But he desired to conciliate the tipsy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
general; and, if he had not been fearful of being
put to the test, he would have signified his belief
that he could carry off half a dozen glasses. As
it was, he did not dare to belie his principles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not any, sir! I never drink whiskey,&#8221; he replied,
with the utmost deference in his tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; gasped General M&mdash;&mdash;, darting a sudden
glance at the young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never drank a glass of whiskey in my life,
sir,&#8221; added Somers.
</p>
<p>The general jumped off his camp-stool with a
sudden jerk, and stared at our lieutenant in silence
for an instant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your hand,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>Somers extended his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! you are flesh and blood. You are the first
man I ever saw that never drank a glass of
whiskey. You drink brandy, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir! I never drank a glass of liquor or
wine of any kind in my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your hand,&#8221; said the general again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Flesh and blood! You are the first man I ever
saw that never drank a glass of liquor or wine of
any kind. &#8217;Tis a bad practice,&#8221; he added with an
oath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, sir,&#8221; replied Somers with due
deference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest enemy&mdash;hic&mdash;that the Confederate
army has to contend against is whiskey.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Yes, sir! whiskey. If the Confederate States of&mdash;hic&mdash;of
America ever win their independence,
it will be when the whiskey&#8217;s all gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to hear officers of your high
rank condemning the practice,&#8221; said Somers, alive
to the joke of the general&#8217;s proceedings, but prudently
looking as serious as though it had been
a solemn tragedy instead of an awful farce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir! I&#8217;m opposed with all my might to
the practice. Yes, sir! Whiskey is the greatest
enemy I have on the face of the footstool, young
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers believed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always be temperate, young man. You are in
the sunshine of&mdash;hic&mdash;of life. Never drink
whiskey. It will ruin your body and soul. Don&#8217;t
touch it, young man,&#8221; added he, as he sank back
on the camp-stool, whose center of gravity was
nearly destroyed by the shock, and closed his eyes,
as if overcome by the potency of his great enemy,
which was just then beginning to have its full
effect, and which produced a tendency to sleep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will endeavor to profit by your good advice,
sir,&#8221; said Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; do so,&#8221; added the general, as he
jerked up his head to banish the drowsy god, who
was struggling for the possession of his senses.
&#8220;That will do, young man. You may go now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The general, in his drunken stupor, had certainly
forgotten the business for which Major Platner
had brought him to the division headquarters;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
and Somers began to fear that he should have no
errand that day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, general; but Major Platner
was kind enough to say that you had some service
for me to perform.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; demanded he, tossing up his head again.
</p>
<p>Somers repeated the remark more explicitly than
before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly so; I remember. Do you know what
I was thinking about just then, young man?&#8221; said
the general, spasmodically leaping to his feet again,
as though the thought was full of inspiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; a man in my humble position could
hardly measure the thoughts of a great man in
your situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you; I was thinking about issuing a
division general order on the subject of temperance.
What do you think of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be an excellent idea,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you said&mdash;hic&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers did not say anything of the sort; but
he waited patiently for the rebel general to recover
the idea which he appeared to have lost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you said you never drank any
whiskey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you never was drunk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a&mdash;hic&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers was not a &#8220;hic;&#8221; but he was an impatient
young man, and very anxious to be instructed
in regard to his difficult and dangerous mission.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a minister of the gospel?&#8221; demanded
the general, after a mighty effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I am not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for&mdash;hic&mdash;for that; for I wanted to
appoint you a division chaplain, to preach against
whiskey to the general officers. Some of them
are&mdash;hic&mdash;drunken fellows, and no more fit for
a command than the old topers in the streets of
Richmond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry I am not competent to fill the office;
but I think, if you should lecture them yourself,
it would have a better effect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My words are&mdash;hic&mdash;powerless. They laugh
when I talk to them about the error of their ways,&#8221;
added he with a string of oaths, which seemed to
exhibit a further necessity for a chaplain on the
division staff.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir; but I am afraid your
interest in the moral welfare of your officers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is it, young man!&#8221; interrupted the
drunken general, catching at his idea with remarkable
promptness. &#8220;My interest in the moral welfare
of my&mdash;hic&mdash;of my officers! You are a trump,
young man [big oath]. You are a major now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a captain?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; nothing but a private.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you shall be a captain. I haven&#8217;t heard
any such&mdash;hic&mdash;sentiments as you expressed used
in this division before. You ought to be a&mdash;hic&mdash;a
brigadier-general.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. You are very kind. I came
to you for instructions in regard to my mission
over to the enemy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless me! yes; so you did. Well, I have not
written them yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only want a pass from you, general, with
such verbal instructions as you may please to give
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you do; the fact of it is, my interest in the
moral welfare of my men had driven the matter
out of my mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The general called an orderly; and Somers was
sent off to the adjutant for the pass, which was
given to him under the name he had assumed.
When he returned, the general was sound asleep
on his camp-stool, rolling about like a ship in a
gale, with a prospect of soon landing at full length
on <i>terra firma</i>. Somers would gladly have received
some military information from the general,
who was in a condition to tell all he knew;
which, however, could not have been much, under
the circumstances. He concluded that it would be
best for him not to awaken the tipsy moralist; and,
after waiting a short time on the spot to avoid
suspicion, he joined Major Platner, who was smoking
his cigar under a tree near the headquarters.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, young man, did you obtain your instructions?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; all I require.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we ought to have seen the general before
dinner,&#8221; added the major, using the remark as
a &#8220;feeler&#8221; to induce his companion to inform him
what had transpired during the interview.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would have been more agreeable
to the general. However, he seemed to be in a
very talkative mood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He commonly is after dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a very jovial, good fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he appears to feel a deep interest in the
moral welfare of those under his command. He
expressed himself as very averse to habits of
intemperance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; coughed the major.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He said that whiskey was the great enemy the
army has to contend against, and intends to issue
a general order directed at the vice of intemperance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did; but I ought to add, that he took me to
be a major in the service; a mistake which was
very natural, since I wore no coat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very natural&mdash;after dinner,&#8221; replied Major
Platner suggestively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him I never drank any strong drink;
and he kindly advised me never to do so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The general is a brave man, and I hope he
will be able to overcome all his enemies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The major permitted the conversation to go by
default, and Somers respectfully dropped a pace
or two behind him. They reached the brigade
headquarters, and then repaired to the guard tent,
from which the scout took his departure upon his
arduous and difficult mission, with the best wishes
of the rebel officers.
</p>
<p>With his pass he had no difficulty in going
through any line, and made his way down to the
woods on the left of the open fields. He began to
feel easier when he had passed the field-works, and
experienced a sensation of exultation as he thought
of the reception which awaited him at headquarters
as well as in the regiment.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE SHARPSHOOTER IN THE WOODS</h3>
</div>

<p>Somers found the picket guard nearer the rebel
line than he had anticipated; but the exhibition
of his pass, which had been prepared with special
reference to this purpose, prevented any long detention,
though a sergeant had to be called who
was scholar enough to read the mysterious document.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you haven&#8217;t got the best place to go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
through,&#8221; said the sergeant, after he had examined
the pass, and satisfied himself of its correctness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a whole squad of Yankees a good piece
in there,&#8221; he replied, pointing in the direction of
the Federal lines. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been there all day
watching for something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a man run through the line this
forenoon from their side, and I reckon they are
trying to find him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he a Yank?&#8221; asked Somers, desirous of
obtaining their idea of the fugitive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno what he was. We didn&#8217;t see him till he
got a good piece behind us. We were chasing the
Yanks who run away when they saw us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was satisfactory to our scout; for the sergeant
appeared to have no knowledge that would
be dangerous to him, and none of the graybacks
recognized the pants he wore. He advanced cautiously,
as though he was afraid of stumbling upon
the squad of Yankees described by the sergeant, till
he could no longer be seen by the pickets. The last
obstacle seemed to be overcome; and he hastened
to the place where he had concealed his uniform,
which he wished to put on before he approached
the pickets on the other side. It was now nearly
dark, and he had no time to spare; for, if he approached
his own men in the darkness, he would
be in danger of being shot before they discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
who he was, though he had full confidence in the
discretion of Hapgood.
</p>
<p>Without difficulty, he found the place where he
had concealed his clothes; and, after assuring himself
that none of the rebel pickets were in sight,
he hastily put them on. To prevent any unpleasant
suspicions, he took the precaution to hide the
gray pants he had worn, in the long grass of the
swamp, so that they need not attract the attention
of any stroller who might pass in that direction.
Though we have frequently held our hero up as a
model of modesty, we are compelled to acknowledge
that he felt exceedingly well satisfied with
himself on the present occasion. He felt that he
had done what, in the homely vocabulary of the
boys of Pinchbrook, might well be called &#8220;a big
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had fully and successfully accomplished the
arduous purposes of his mission. He had examined
the positions, and counted the forces of the
rebels. He had received very valuable information
from Mr. Raynes, and from others whom he had
encountered in his walk through the enemy&#8217;s lines.
He was satisfied that he should receive a warm
welcome from those who had sent him upon the
perilous tour. He had earned the first bar to his
shoulder-straps, and was proud of his achievement.
</p>
<p>The work had been done, and he was within a
short distance of the Union lines&mdash;within a short
distance of the devoted Hapgood, who was patiently
but anxiously waiting to give him a soldier&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
reception. Above all, he was safe; and he
trembled when he thought of the perils through
which he had passed, of the consequences which
must have followed the discovery of his real character.
As he thanked God for the boon of life
after the battle was over, so now he thanked Him
for the signal success which had crowned his labors
in the good cause. The last article of his raiment
was put on and adjusted; he rose from the ground
to walk towards the Union lines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Yank, you look better&#8217;n you did &#8217;fore
yer changed your clothes,&#8221; said a voice, which
struck his ear with startling distinctness.
</p>
<p>Somers looked in the direction from which the
voice came, and discovered a villainous-looking
countenance, that had just risen from the tall
swamp-grass, within a couple of rods of the
spot where he stood. The man was unmistakably
a rebel&mdash;one of the most savage and implacable
of rebels at that; such a character as we read of
in connection with slave-hunts in Mississippi, or
&#8220;free fights&#8221; in Arkansas. He wore a long,
tangled beard; and his hair had probably never
known the use of a comb. The grayback looked
as cool and impudent as though he was perfectly
assured of his prey, and intended to torture his
victim with his tongue, as he would with his knife
or his rifle if occasion required.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Yank, you look better&#8217;n yer did &#8217;fore
yer changed your colors,&#8221; repeated the rebel, as he
received no reply to his first salutation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>Somers looked at him again; indeed, he had
hardly taken his eyes off the savage-looking fellow,
who would have made a very good representative
of Orson in the fairy story. He held a rifle
in his hand, the muzzle of which could easily be
brought to bear upon his victim. Our lieutenant
at once understood the humor of the fellow; and,
having recovered his self-possession in the momentary
pause, he determined not to be behind his foe
either in word or in deed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, reb, when did you shave last?&#8221; demanded
Somers, with something as near akin to
a laugh as he could manufacture for the occasion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fore you was born, I reckon, Yank,&#8221; replied
the rebel; &#8220;and I sha&#8216;n&#8217;t shave ag&#8217;in till after
you&#8217;re dead. But I reckon I sha&#8216;n&#8217;t hev ter wait
long nuther.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you don&#8217;t know what a comb is for,
do you?&#8221; continued Somers, who was, however,
thinking of some method by which he might get
out of this scrape.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve heerd about such things; but Joe
Bagbone ain&#8217;t a woman, and don&#8217;t waste his time
no such way. I say, stranger, you&#8217;ve got about
three minutes more to live.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three minutes, stranger, I&#8217;ve sat here by
them clothes, like a dog at a &#8217;possum&#8217;s nest, all the
arternoon. Now I&#8217;ve treed the critter, and I&#8217;m
gwine to shoot him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, stranger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you usually shoot any man you happen to
meet in the woods?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t reckon we do, every man; but
some on &#8217;em we does. I calkilate you got on Tom
Myers&#8217;s clothes now, and yer shot the man &#8217;fore
you took the rags.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t shoot him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter for that, stranger; he was shot by
a Yank, and you&#8217;ve got to settle the account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers began to be of the same opinion himself.
The grayback had evidently found the clothes, and
suspected the purpose for which they were concealed.
It was possible he had even more definite
information than this; for he seemed to be prepared
for precisely what had taken place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not your friend, stranger. You kin say
anything you like, if yer don&#8217;t insult me; Joe Bagbone
don&#8217;t take an insult from any live man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Joe Bagbone,&#8221; continued Somers, who
was disposed to parley with the fellow to gain
time, if nothing else, &#8220;if you shoot me, you will
make the worst mistake you ever made in your
life; and I can prove it to you in less than five
minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, yer can&#8217;t, stranger. Don&#8217;t waste yer time
no such way. If yer want ter say yer prayers,
blaze away lively, &#8217;cause three minutes aren&#8217;t long
for a man to repent of all his sins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a pass from General M&mdash;&mdash;, which permits
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
me to go in safety through these lines,&#8221; persisted
Somers. &#8220;The sergeant above just examined
it, and passed me through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t keer nothing about yer pass. I respects
Jeff Davis just as much as the best man in Mississip&#8217;.
If yer had a pass from him, you mought as
well not have it as have it. Tom Myers was killed,
and somebody&#8217;s gwine up for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have important business on the other
side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knows that, stranger,&#8221; replied the imperturbable
Joe Bagbone. &#8220;It don&#8217;t make no difference.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sent over by General M&mdash;&mdash;. I belong
to the Fourth Alabama.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shet up! Don&#8217;t tell no lies, &#8217;cause yer hain&#8217;t
got no time ter repent on &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if I understand it, you mean to murder
one of your own men in cold blood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; of the sort; only gwine to shoot a
Yank.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers looked into that hard, relentless eye;
but there was not the slightest indication of any
change of purpose. He felt that he stood in the
presence of his executioner. All the errors of his
past life crowded upon him, and the grave seemed
to yawn before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call the sergeant above, and he will satisfy
you that I am all right,&#8221; said he, making one more
effort to move the villain from his wicked purpose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want the sergeant. Yer time&#8217;s out,
stranger.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let me call him, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If yer do, I&#8217;ll fire. Say yer prayers now, if
yer mean ter; but I reckon the prayers of a Yank
ain&#8217;t of much account,&#8221; replied Joe with a sneer.
</p>
<p>Somers stood within a few feet of a large tree.
Joe had several times raised his rifle to his shoulder;
but, when he magnanimously offered his victim
the last moment of grace, he dropped it again;
and our lieutenant, taking advantage of this interval,
darted behind the tree. Joe raised his piece
quicker than a flash; but he did not fire, for the
reason that he could not secure a perfect aim, and
because he was sure of a better opportunity. Our
lieutenant, who had carefully preserved his revolver
during the various changes he had made in
his dress, now took it from his pocket, and prepared
to contest the field like a man.
</p>
<p>The grayback, chagrined at this movement on
the part of his victim, whom he had evidently
intended to intimidate by his coolness and his ferocious
words, rose from his seat in the long grass,
and moved towards the tree behind which Somers
had taken refuge. Probably he was not aware
that the Yankee was armed; for he adopted none
of the precautions which such a knowledge would
have imposed upon any reasonable man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out from that tree, stranger, or you shall
die like a hog, with a knife; not like a man, with
a rifle-ball.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I intend to die by neither,&#8221; said Somers resolutely,
as he discharged his pistol in the direction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
from which the voice of the grayback came; for
he dared not take aim, lest the bullet of the ruffian
should pierce his skull.
</p>
<p>He might as well have fired into the air, so far
as any injury to his enemy was concerned; but the
report had the effect to assure the rebel that he
was armed, and thus put an end to his farther advance
in that direction. Somers listened with
intense anxiety to discover the next movement of
his wily persecutor. He had only checked, not
defeated him; and an exciting game was commenced,
which promised to terminate only in the
death of one of the belligerents. Somers hoped
that the discharge of his pistol would bring the
sergeant down to his relief; but then to be discovered
in Federal uniform was about equivalent
to being shot by his relentless foe, burning to revenge
the death of Tom Myers.
</p>
<p>The report of pistols and muskets was so common
an occurrence on the picket-lines as to occasion
nothing more than a momentary inquiry. No
one came for his relief, or his ruin, as the case
might be; and he was left to play out the exciting
game by himself. The grayback, with a wholesome
regard for the pistol, had retired beyond the
reach of its ball, while he was still a long way within
rifle-range of his doomed enemy. Somers dared
not look out from the tree to obtain even a single
glance at the foe; for he knew how accurate is
the aim of some of these Southern woodsmen. He
had nothing to guide him but the rustling of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
dried branches beneath his tread, or the occasional
snapping of a twig under his feet.
</p>
<p>Joe Bagbone, after retreating beyond pistol-shot
from the tree, had commenced describing a circle
which would bring him into a position that commanded
a view of his concealed victim. It must
be confessed that Joe&#8217;s tactics were singularly deficient
in range; for nothing but a surprise could
make them successful. While he was moving a
hundred rods to secure his position, Somers could
defeat his purpose by taking a single step. As
soon as he determined in what direction his persecutor
was going, he changed his position; and
Joe discovered the folly of his strategy, and sat
down on a stump to await a demonstration on the
part of his victim.
</p>
<p>The game promised to be prolonged to a most
unreasonable length; and Somers, now in a
measure secure of his life, was impatient to join
his anxious companions, with whom he had parted
in the forenoon. He was satisfied that Joe would
never abandon the chase, and the slightest indiscretion
on his own part would result in instant
death. It was a fearful position, and one which
was calculated to wear terribly upon his nerves.
He was anxious to bring the contest to a conclusion;
and, while he was debating in his own mind
the chances of escaping by a sudden dash in the
direction of the Union lines, a happy thought in
the way of strategy occurred to him.
</p>
<p>He had determined as nearly as he could the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
situation of his bull-dog opponent, and thought
that, if he could draw his fire, he might get out of
range of his rifle before it could be reloaded.
Placing his cap on the barrel of his pistol, he
cautiously moved it over, just as it would have
appeared to the rebel if his head had been inside
of it, and projected it a little beyond the tree. He
withdrew it suddenly two or three times to increase
the delusion in the mind of his enemy. He
could not see the effect of the stratagem; but he
was hopeful of a satisfactory result. He continued
to repeat the operation with the cap, till
he was confident Joe was not to be fooled in this
way. He was probably one of the sharpshooters,
and had too often fired at empty caps to be caught
in this manner when success depended upon the
single charge of his rifle.
</p>
<p>Somers did not despair, but slipped off his coat;
and, rolling it up so as to form the semblance of
a head, he placed the cap upon the top of the
bundle, and cautiously exposed the &#8220;dummy&#8221; on
the opposite side of the tree. The crack of Joe&#8217;s
rifle instantly followed this exhibition, and Somers
felt the blow of the ball when it struck the cap.
The critical moment had come; and, without the
loss of a second, our lieutenant darted towards
the Union lines. This movement was followed by
a shrill yell from the Mississippian, which might
have been a howl of disappointment at his failure;
or it might have been intended to startle, and thus
delay the fugitive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>Somers had listened to that battle yell too many
times to be moved by it, especially when uttered by
a single voice; and, with all the speed of which his
limbs were capable, he fled to the arms of his
friends. Joe was not content to give up the battle;
and, dropping his rifle, he drew his long knife, and
gave chase. They made a long run of it; and it
was only ended when Tom heard the demand of
his faithful sergeant&mdash;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend,&#8221; gasped Somers, utterly exhausted by
his exertions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers? God be praised!&#8221; replied
Hapgood, instantly recognizing his voice.
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>RETURN TO THE CAMP</h3>
</div>

<p>The moment Somers was recognized, Hapgood
and his party rushed forward, rightly judging,
from the rapidity of his motions, that he was pursued.
The sharp eye of the veteran sergeant was
the first to perceive the ferocious Mississippian,
who, undaunted by the appearance of the Union
soldiers, continued the pursuit as long as there
was even a gleam of hope that he could overtake
his intended victim. He was only a few paces behind
the lieutenant when the latter was discovered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>Hapgood raised his musket and fired, just as
the implacable pursuer abandoned the chase, and
turned his steps back to the rebel line. He staggered
for a few paces more, and fell just as a dozen
other muskets were leveled at him. He appeared
to have been hit in the leg; for he did not fall flat
upon the ground, as he would if he had been struck
in a vital part, but sank down to a sitting posture.
</p>
<p>The Union men rushed up to him, and found
that the supposition was correct; the ball had
passed through the fleshy part of his thigh, disabling,
but not dangerously wounding him. The
ruffian&mdash;we do not call him so because he was a
rebel, but he was naturally and by education just
what the term indicates&mdash;was as savage and implacable
as before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better leave me where I am, Yanks,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;&#8217;case, if I get well, I shall be the death of some
of you. You kin shoot me through the head if you
like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t consarn yourself about us, reb,&#8221; replied
Hapgood. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take good care that you don&#8217;t
hurt yourself, or any one else, while you are in our
hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you will, Yanks; but, just as sure as
you was born, I&#8217;ll hev the heart&#8217;s blood of that
younker as fotched Tom Myers down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Tom Myers?&#8221; demanded the veteran.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man that you Yanks killed this forenoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose heart&#8217;s blood do you want?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That younker with the badge on his shoulder;
the un I chased in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t kill Tom Myers, or any other man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Show me the man, then,&#8221; growled the rebel,
now beginning to feel the pain of his wound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your man. I brought Tom Myers down,&#8221;
replied Hapgood, anxious to remove any cause of
peril from his <i>protégé</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did yer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartin I did; saw him drop when I fired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, stranger, yer kin make up yer mind to
die like a hog within ten days. I tell yer, Yank,
there ain&#8217;t bolts and bars enough in Yankee land
to keep me away from yer. You kin shoot me if
yer like now, and that&#8217;s all the way yer kin save
yerself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, reb, you are great at blowing; but I&#8217;ve
seen a good many jest sich fellers as you be. I&#8217;ve
fit with &#8217;em, and fit agin&#8217; &#8217;em; and I tell you, your
uncle can take keer of just as many of you as can
stand up between here and sundown. Put that in
your hopper, reb; and the sooner you dry up, the
sooner you&#8217;ll come to your milk. We&#8217;ll take keer
on you like a Christian, though you ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
but a heathen. Here, boys, make a stretcher, and
kerry him along. Take that jack-knife out of his
hand fust, and keep one eye on him all the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having thus delivered himself, Sergeant Hapgood
hastened to the spot where Somers had seated
himself on the ground to recover his wind and rest
his weary limbs. The terrible excitement of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
last hour seemed to fatigue him more than the previous
labors of the whole day; and he was hardly
in condition to march to the division headquarters,
where he was to report the success of his mission.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom&mdash;I mean Lieutenant Somers&mdash;I&#8217;m
glad to see you!&#8221; exclaimed the veteran as he
grasped both the hands of the young soldier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, uncle; I&#8217;m just as glad to see you
as you can be to see me,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all tuckered out, Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to run for some distance, with the odds
against me; but I shall get rested in a little while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sergeant began to ask questions; and, as
soon as he had recovered his breath, Somers gave
him a brief sketch of his adventures, dwelling
mainly on the last and most thrilling event of the
day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hardly believe that I am alive and well
after all that has happened,&#8221; said he in conclusion.
&#8220;That was the most bloodthirsty villain I ever
encountered in the whole course of my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you say shoot him, leftenant, it shall be done
quicker&#8217;n you can say Jack Roberson,&#8221; added Hapgood,
indignant at the conduct of the savage rebel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t say anything of that kind.
It would be murder to do anything of that sort
while he is our prisoner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He desarves hanging more&#8217;n Kyd the pirate
did; and if I had my way, he&#8217;d swing afore sunrise
to-morrow. He&#8217;s a consarned heathen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind him; only keep him safe, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
where he can&#8217;t do any mischief; for he is wicked
enough to kill the man that feeds him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only sorry I didn&#8217;t hit him a little higher
up, where I hit the other feller this mornin&#8217;,&#8221;
added the veteran. &#8220;How do you feel now,
leftenant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am improving. I shall be ready to go with
you in a few moments more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After sitting on the stump half an hour longer,
he was in condition to march; but the danger was
past, the tremendous excitement had subsided, and
his muscles, which had been strained up to the
highest tension, seemed to become soft and flaccid.
The party passed the Union pickets, and reached
the headquarters of the division general, who had
just finished his supper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers! by all that is great and good!&#8221; exclaimed
the general, who probably never expected
to see the scout again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to make my report, sir,&#8221; replied
the lieutenant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are all used up. You look as though you
could hardly stand up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very tired, sir,&#8221; added Somers languidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, then. Here, Peter,&#8221; he added, addressing
his servant, &#8220;bring in a glass of whiskey
for Lieutenant Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, general; I never drink anything
stronger than coffee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But a little whiskey would do you good in your
present condition; you need it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, general; I never drink whiskey,
as I had occasion to say to a rebel general of division
to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? &#8217;Pon my conscience! Were you asked to
drink by a rebel major-general?&#8221; demanded the
officer, greatly surprised at the statement of the
scout
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly, sir. About the first question he
asked me was, how much whiskey I could drink
without going by the board.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was he? Bring coffee, Peter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;General M&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I supposed. He is a jovial, good-hearted
fellow; but I&#8217;ll wager my shoulder-straps he was
tight at the time,&#8221; laughed the general.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very tight, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he is a fighting man, drunk or sober; but
I should rather lead than follow him in action.
Where have you been all day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell my story in full, or only give you
the information I obtained?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell the story, so that I can determine whether
the information is good for anything or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers drank the tin cup of coffee which the
general&#8217;s servant brought to him, and then proceeded
to relate the incidents of the day in the
rebel camp. His distinguished auditor, who, in
the Army of the Potomac, had well earned the
title of &#8220;the bravest of the brave,&#8221; listened with
eager interest to the details of the lieutenant&#8217;s
story, asking occasional questions upon points
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
which were not only calculated to elicit particular
information, but to display the skill and intelligence
of the scout. The interview was prolonged
for several hours; and at its close a staff-officer
was despatched to the corps commander; for what
purpose, of course, Somers had no intimation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, you have earned your promotion;
and if you don&#8217;t have it, it will be because
I have not influence enough to procure it. You
have done well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend, Senator Guilford, shall hear of
you within forty-eight hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir; but, grateful as I am
to Senator Guilford for the interest he has expressed
in me, I don&#8217;t care to be patronized by any
man in civil life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; laughed the general. &#8220;I wish some
of our colonels and brigadiers would take a lesson
from you. Never mind, Lieutenant Somers; you
will deserve all you ever get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to your quarters now. Here,&#8221; he added,
dashing off a note at his table, in which he desired
that Somers might be excused from duty for
the next two days, to enable him to recover from
the fatigues of his arduous expedition.
</p>
<p>I need not inform my readers how soundly our
hero slept in his shelter tent that night, nor how
his slumbers were disturbed by a horrid rebel with
a bowie-knife, and a horrid feminine monstrosity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
which seemed to be called Sue by her attendant
demons; but he slept as a tired boy only can sleep.
</p>
<p>The next morning the brigade was relieved from
picket duty, and the regiment returned to its
camp. Captain de Banyan had neither seen nor
heard from his young friend since his departure
on the forenoon of the preceding day. Of course
he was overjoyed to see him, as well as intensely
curious to know where he had been, what he had
done, and whether he had been promoted. Somers
told his adventures to the mess, omitting such
military information as was &#8220;contraband&#8221; in the
camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, my dear fellow, you are a man after
my own heart!&#8221; exclaimed the captain, grasping
his hand, and wringing it with all the enthusiasm
of his fervid nature. &#8220;Somers, my boy, did you
ever hear of a man having his double?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have read of such things in old legends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in it, Somers. You are my double!
You are my second self! You are as near like me
as one pea is like another! Just before the battle
of Magenta&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this interesting point in the conversation, the
officers of the mess burst into an involuntary roar
of laughter, ending up Magenta with a long dash.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly like you, Captain de Banyan,&#8221;
added Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell half so big a story,&#8221; said Lieutenant
Munroe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; interposed the captain with dignity,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
&#8220;you interrupted me at the wrong moment.
I was about to prove to you wherein Lieutenant
Somers was my double; and with your permission,
I will proceed with my argument. Just before the
battle of Magenta, I was sent out on a scout; and
I went at the particular request of the Emperor
Napoleon, who&mdash;permit me to add, in the presence
of a company which seems to be inimical to my
antecedents, if not to me&mdash;had unlimited confidence
in my ability to perform this delicate duty
with skill and success. Well, gentlemen, I passed
our pickets; of course I mean the French pickets;
for I was, as you are all aware, a colonel in the
French infantry at that time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all aware of it,&#8221; laughed Munroe&mdash;&#8220;over
the left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a slang phrase, and repulsive to the
ears of a cultivated gentleman. As I was saying,
gentlemen, I passed our pickets, and soon encountered
a Russian general of division.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Russian?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Austrian, I should have said; and I thank you,
Somers, for the correction. I suppose he was making
the grand rounds with the officer of the day.
Be that as it may, he considered it his duty to stop
me; and I was under the disagreeable necessity
of putting a bullet through his head. He was a
count, and the father of a large family; however,
I could not help it, though I was sorry to make
orphans of his children. I stepped into his uniform
without the delay of a moment.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where was the sergeant of the guard, the
officer of the day, and the sentinels?&#8221; demanded
Lieutenant Munroe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg you will not interrupt me, Lieutenant
Munroe, with these ill-timed remarks, which are
merely intended to throw discredit on my character
for truth and veracity. I remarked, that I
stepped into the uniform of the defunct major-general.
To abbreviate the narrative somewhat,
I walked through the Austrian lines for three
hours, till I had discovered the position of the infantry,
cavalry and artillery. But the most singular
part of the affair was, that, when the long roll
was beat once during that eventful night, I placed
myself at the head of the departed general&#8217;s division,
and maneuvered it for an hour on the field,
intending to place it in such a position that the
French could capture it. Unfortunately, no attack
was made by the Emperor&#8217;s forces, and I
could not carry out my plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you talk the Austrian lingo, captain?&#8221;
asked Munroe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I can,&#8221; replied De Banyan with dignity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Schrugenheimer, let us have a specimen
of the lingo!&#8221; said the tormentor, appealing to a
German officer. &#8220;Ask him some questions in your
own language.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, if my word is not sufficient, I shall
not condescend to demonstrate what I have said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
You will notice the similarity between the adventures
of Lieutenant Somers and my own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officers of the mess all laughed heartily at
the conclusion of the comparison; for the story,
like a fairy tale, was pleasant to hear, but hard to
believe. But weightier matters than these were at
hand for these gallant men; and before night the
gay laugh had ceased, and they had nerved themselves
for the stern duties of the hour. Cannon
had been thundering to the right of them for three
days; and in the afternoon they had seen the smoke
of burning bridges, which assured them that their
communications with White House had been cut
off. At night, orders were given to have the men
ready to move, and to prepare for a hurried march.
Extra stores were destroyed, clothing thrown
away, and tents were cut in pieces, or otherwise
rendered useless to the next occupants of the
ground. Everything to be transported was reduced
to the smallest possible compass.
</p>
<p>These orders were ominous of disaster; but on
the following morning a general order was read,
to the effect that all was right. The troubled expression
on the countenances of officers and men
indicated their incredulity; for the destruction in
which they had been engaged belied the words of
the order. The brigade was then moved back three
miles from the camp. A portion of the regiment
was posted near a house, in which was a bedridden
old woman, attended by her daughter. The rebels
were advancing by the Williamsburg road, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
soon had a battery of artillery in position to shell
the vicinity of the house.
</p>
<p>It was an intensely hot day. Captain de Banyan
sat asleep on the fence near the house. He was
very much exhausted by the labors of the two preceding
nights on picket, and at the destruction of
the stores; and while Somers was watching the
progress of the battle on the right, where a sharp
fight was in progress, a shell screamed between
them, and struck the house about a foot from the
ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That reminds me of the night before Magenta,&#8221;
said the veteran, opening his eyes, without
even a start. &#8220;A hundred-pounder shell knocked
my hat off, and then passed through the two open
windows at each gable of a house, without even
breaking a pane of glass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A narrow escape for you and for the house,&#8221;
replied Somers with a languid smile.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>GLENDALE AND MALVERN HILLS</h3>
</div>

<p>Captain de Banyan was as cool and indifferent
to danger as though he had been shot-proof.
Cannon-balls and shell flew through the air; but the
veteran paid no attention to them&mdash;except that
once in a while they reminded him of Magenta, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
some other of the numerous battle-fields where he
had displayed his valor. There was little fighting
for our regiment at this point, though there was a
sharp action on the right of the position.
</p>
<p>The rebels attacked our forces with tremendous
vigor at Savage&#8217;s Station. It was believed by their
generals that the Union army was utterly demoralized;
that it was retreating in disorder towards
the James River; and that a vigorous onslaught
would result in its capture. The first intimation
of the blunder was received at Savage&#8217;s Station,
where the Confederates were decisively repulsed;
yet the hope was not abandoned of ending the war
by the destruction of the Army of the Potomac.
The hosts of the rebellion were poured down the
roads, where they could intercept the loyal forces;
and the full extent of their blunder was realized
only at Malvern Hills.
</p>
<p>At noon our regiment marched through White
Oak Swamp, and late in the evening bivouacked
in a field near the road. During all this time the
road was filled with troops, and with trains of
army wagons on their way to the new &#8220;base.&#8221;
Very early the next morning, the march was resumed.
It was an exceedingly hot day, and the
troops suffered severely from the heat. Somers
was nearly exhausted when the regiment halted
at noon near a church, which the surgeons had already
occupied as a hospital. But nothing could
disturb the equanimity of Captain de Banyan. If
an opportunity offered, he rested, and went to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
sleep amid the screaming shells as readily as
though he had been in his chamber in the &#8220;Fifth
Avenue.&#8221; It was not quite so hot as it was at
Magenta, nor the march quite so severe as before
Solferino, nor the shot quite so thick as at Chapultepec.
He never grumbled himself, and never
permitted any one else to do so. If Somers ventured
to suggest that events were rather hard upon
him, he wondered what he would have done if he
had been at Magenta, Solferino, Balaclava, or
Chapultepec.
</p>
<p>Somers was disposed to make the best of the
circumstances; and though hungry, tired and
nearly melted, he sustained himself with unfaltering
courage amid the trials of that eventful march.
All day long, the tide of army wagons and cattle
flowed down the road; and the brigade remained
near the church at Glendale, waiting for them to
pass. At dark the order was given to move forward,
while the roar of cannon and musketry reverberated
on the evening air, assuring the weary
veterans that the baptism of blood was at hand for
them, as it had been before for their comrades
in arms.
</p>
<p>The regiment followed a narrow road through
the woods, which was thronged with the <i>débris</i>
of the conflict, hurled back by the fierce assaults
of the rebels. The cowardly skulkers and the noncombatants
of the engaged regiments were here
with their tale of disaster and ruin; and, judging
from the mournful stories they told, the once proud
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Army of the Potomac had been utterly routed and
discomfited. Cowards with one bar, cowards with
two bars, cowards with no bar, and cowards with
the eagle on their shoulders, repeated the wail of
disaster; and the timid would have shrunk from
the fiery ordeal before them, if the intrepid officers
and the mass of the rank and file had not been
above the influence of the poltroons&#8217; trembling
tones and quaking limbs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward, my brave boys! I&#8217;ve been waiting
all my lifetime for such a scene as this!&#8221; shouted
Captain de Banyan, as he flourished his sword
after the most approved style.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind the cowards!&#8221; said Somers, as the
stragglers poured out their howls of terror.
</p>
<p>There was little need of these stirring exhortations;
for the men were as eager for the fight as
the officers, and laughed with genuine glee at the
pitiful aspect of the runaways. They advanced
in line of battle to the support of the hard-pressed
troops in front of them, and poured a withering
fire into the enemy. With that fiendish yell which
the Southern soldiers invariably use in the hour of
battle, they rushed forward with a fury which was
madness, and into which no fear of death entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are coming!&#8221; shouted Somers, as the
legions of rebellion surged down upon the line,
yelling like so many demons, as though they expected
the veterans to be vanquished by mere noise.
&#8220;Stand steady, my men!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That reminds me of the Russian advance at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Magenta,&#8221; said Captain de Banyan, who happened
to pass near the spot where Somers stood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Austrians, you mean,&#8221; replied Somers,
trying to keep as cool and unmoved as his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me; I meant the Austrians,&#8221; replied
the captain. &#8220;The fact is&mdash;&mdash;Forward, my brave
fellows!&#8221; roared he as the order came down the
line.
</p>
<p>The enemy had been temporarily checked, and
the brigade advanced to pursue the advantage
gained. They poured another terrible volley into
the rebels; when a regiment of the latter, infuriated
by whiskey and the fierce goadings of their
officers, rushed down with irresistible force upon
a portion of the Union line, and succeeded in making
a partial break in our regiment. The only remaining
line officer in one of the companies where
the rupture occurred was wounded at this critical
moment, and borne under the feet of the excited
combatants.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers, take command of that company!&#8221;
shouted the colonel, as he dashed towards
the imperiled portion of the line.
</p>
<p>Somers made haste to obey the order when the
line was giving way before the impetuous charge.
He felt that the safety of the whole army depended
upon himself at that momentous instant, and that
on the salvation of the army rested the destiny of
his country. What was the life of a single man,
of a hundred thousand even, compared with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
fearful issue of that moment? It was the feeling
of the young soldier, and he was ready to lay down
his life for the flag which symbolized the true
glory of the nation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rally round me!&#8221; he cried, as he discharged
his revolver into the breast of a brave captain who
was urging his company forward with the most
unflinching resolution. &#8220;Down with them!&#8221; he
shouted, as he waved his sword above his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; roared a brave sergeant near him,
and the cry was taken up by the gallant fellows
who had been pressed back by sheer force of numbers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; shouted Somers, as he dashed
down a bayonet, which would have transfixed him
on the spot if he had not been on the alert.
</p>
<p>The men rallied, and stood boldly up to the
work before them. They were inspired by the example
of the young lieutenant; and the rebel regiment
slowly and doggedly retired, leaving many
of their number dead or wounded on the field, and
a small number as prisoners in the hands of
Somers&#8217;s new command.
</p>
<p>After alternate repulses and successes, the rebels
were signally
defeated and driven back. It was
a sharp and decisive struggle; but again had the
army been saved from destruction, and the long
line of army wagons still pursued its way in safety
towards the waters of the James.
</p>
<p>Again had the rebel general&#8217;s brilliant calculation
failed. His troops, maddened by the fires of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
the whiskey demon, had done all that men or fiends
could do; but the trained valor of the Army of the
Potomac had again saved the country. Onward
it marched towards the goal of safety under the
sheltering wings of the gunboat fleet in the river.
</p>
<p>All night long the men marched, with frequent
intervals of rest, as the movements of the army
trains required them. There was no sleep, even
after that hard-fought battle; no real rest from the
exciting and wearing events of the day. There was
little or no food to be had; and the fainting soldiers,
though still ready to fight and march in
their weakness, longed for the repose of a few
hours in camp. But not yet was the boon to be
granted. On the following morning, our regiment
arrived at Malvern Hills, where they were again
formed in line of battle, in readiness to receive
the menacing hosts of the rebels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all right now, Somers,&#8221; said Captain
de Banyan while they were waiting for the onset.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite yet, captain. Don&#8217;t you see those
signal-flags on the houses yonder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They mean something, of course. I did not
intend to say there will be no fighting; only, that
we have a good position, and all the rebels in the
Confederacy can&#8217;t start us now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those flags indicate that the rebels are moving.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them come; the sooner the better, and the
sooner it will be over. Hurrah!&#8221; exclaimed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
captain, as the inspiring strains of the band in
the rear saluted his ears.
</p>
<p>Cheer after cheer passed along the extended
lines as the notes of the &#8220;Star-spangled Banner&#8221;
thrilled the hearts of the weary, fainting soldiers.
The bands had not been heard during the operations
in front of Richmond; and their music, as
Sergeant Hapgood expressed it, &#8220;sounded like
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That does me good, Somers,&#8221; continued the
captain. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like music for the
nerves. It wakes men up, and makes them forget
all their troubles. Forward, the light brigade!&#8221;
he added, flourishing his sword in the air. &#8220;I suppose
you know that poem, Somers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; I know it by heart; read it in school
the last day I ever went.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you, indeed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing very singular about that, is there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather a remarkable coincidence, I should
say,&#8221; replied the captain with easy indifference,
as he twirled his sword on the ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You read the poem at school, and I was in that
charge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my boy. I was a captain in that brigade.
But what called the circumstance to my mind was
the music which struck up just now. I had a bugler
in my company who played &#8216;Hail, Columbia&#8217; during
the whole of the fight.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hail, Columbia?&#8217;&#8221; demanded Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly; the fellow had a fancy for that
tune; and though it wasn&#8217;t exactly a national
thing to the British army, he always played it
when he got a chance. Well, sir, I think that bugler
did more than any other man in the charge of
the light brigade. He never lost a note, and it
fired the men up to the pitch of frenzy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a brave fellow,&#8221; replied Somers languidly;
for he was too thoroughly worn out to appreciate
the stories of his veteran companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the most determined man I ever met
in my life. He was killed in the charge, poor fellow;
but he had filled his bugle so full of wind,
that the music did not cease till full five minutes
after he was stone-dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, captain! that&#8217;s a little too bad,&#8221;
said Somers seriously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad? Well, I should not be willing to
take oath that the time was just five minutes after
the bugler died. I did not take out my watch, and
time it; and, of course, I can only give you my
judgment as to the precise number of minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are worse than Baron Munchausen, who
told a story something like that; only his was the
more reasonable of the two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, my boy! you have got a villainously
bad habit of discrediting the statements of a
brother-officer and a gentleman,&#8221; said Captain de
Banyan seriously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have got a bad habit of telling the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
most abominable stories that ever proceeded from
the mouth of any man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll drop the subject, Somers; for such discussions
lead to unpleasant results. Do you see
that rebel battery?&#8221; added the captain, pointing
to a road a mile off, where the enemy had taken
position to shell the Union line.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rebel battery opened fire, which was vigorously
answered by the other side. The scene began
to increase in interest as the cannonade extended
along the whole line; and, through the entire
day, there raged the most furious artillery
conflict of the war. The rebel masses were hurled
time after time against the Union line; but it
maintained its position like a wall of iron, while
thousands of the enemy were recklessly sacrificed
in the useless assault. General M&mdash;&mdash; had probably
drunk more than his usual quantity of whiskey;
and, though he was as brave as a lion, hundreds of
his men paid the penalty with their lives of his
rashness and indiscretion.
</p>
<p>Night came again upon a victorious field, while
hundreds of weeping mothers in the neighboring
city sighed for the sons who would return no more
to their arms; and while mothers wept, fathers
groaned and sisters moaned, the grand army of
the Confederacy had been beaten, and the proud
rulers of an infatuated people were trembling for
their own safety in the presence of the ruin with
which defeat threatened them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>After the battle commenced the movement of the
Army of the Potomac down the river to Harrison&#8217;s
Landing. The rain fell in torrents, and the
single road was crowded with troops and wagons.
Though the exhausted soldiers slept, even while
the guns of the enemy roared in front of them, and
during the brief halts which the confusion in the
road caused, there was no real repose. The excitement
of the battle and the retreat, and the undefinable
sense of insecurity which their situation
engendered, banished rest. Tired Nature asserted
her claims, and the men yielded to them only when
endurance had reached its utmost limit.
</p>
<p>At Harrison&#8217;s Landing, the work of intrenching
the position was immediately commenced; and it
was some days before the army were entirely assured
that defeat and capture were not still possible.
The failure of the campaign was not without
its effect upon the troops. They felt, that, instead
of marching under their victorious banners into
the enemy&#8217;s capital, they had been driven from
their position. It was not disaster, but it was
failure. Though the soldiers were still in good
condition, and as ready as ever to breast the storm
of battle, they were in a measure dispirited by the
misfortune.
</p>
<p>General McClellan and General Lee had each
failed to accomplish his purpose. It was the intention
of the latter to send Stonewall Jackson into
the rear of the Union army, cut it off from its base
of supplies, and then attack in front and on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
left. The plan was defeated by General McClellan&#8217;s
change of base, which was forced upon him
by the cutting-off of his communications with the
Pamunkey River. The Union generals, who were
first attacked on the right, supposed they were
confronted by Jackson, who had come down to
flank them in this direction; while Lee intended
that he should attack farther down the Peninsula.
Each commanding general, to some extent,
mistook the purpose of the other. Whatever errors
were made by the grand players in this mighty
game, about one thing there can be no mistake&mdash;that
the courage and fortitude of the rank and file
saved the Army of the Potomac, and pushed aside
the mighty disaster in which its ruin would have
involved the country. All honor to the unnamed
heroes who fought those great battles, and endured
hardships which shall thrill the souls of Americans
for ages to come!

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>LIEUTENANT SOMERS HAS A NEW SENSATION</h3>
</div>

<p>The experience of the soldiers at Harrison&#8217;s
Landing, for a month following their arrival, was
not of the most agreeable nature; and consisted
of too large a proportion of exercise with pick and
shovel to be very pleasant to those who had not
been accustomed to handling these useful implements.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
Intrenchments and batteries were constructed;
and the position was as carefully fortified
as the genius of the distinguished engineer in command
could suggest, and as thoroughly as though
he expected to spent the balance of the term of his
natural life at this place.
</p>
<p>The army was soon in a condition to defy the
operations of the enemy, who were wise enough
not to molest it. Somers, in common with the rest
of the command, recovered from the severe trials
of the movement from White Oak Swamp, and
again longed for active operations. About two
weeks after the cessation of active operations, the
official documents which announced his promotion
to the rank of first lieutenant came down to the
army; but this was a foregone conclusion. He had
won his first bar by his scouting services, and his
commission was expected for a fortnight before its
arrival. It did not, therefore, cause him any surprise;
and was so small an elevation, that his comrades
hardly congratulated him upon its reception.
</p>
<p>A fortnight later, there came a startling sensation
to thrill him with satisfaction and delight.
An orderly from the division headquarters summoned
him to attend upon the general. The message
startled him; for it indicated some momentous
event to him, and he hastily prepared to obey
the order.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in luck again,&#8221; said De Banyan, grasping
his hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; replied Somers, bewildered at
the suggestion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are, my dear boy. I was sent for
just four weeks after the battle of Solferino, and
made a brigadier-general,&#8221; persisted the captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! then you are General de Banyan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; I dropped the title when I ceased to
hold the office.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was modest, general.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, if you please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are entitled by courtesy to the use of the
title, and you shall not be robbed of any of your
honors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a particular favor, Somers, never call me
general. I do not wish to rise above my actual
rank. I have never mentioned the little circumstance
of my promotion before. Your good fortune
was so similar to my own, that I was surprised
into doing so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by my good fortune,
captain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are promoted again. I will bet my
year&#8217;s pay you have had another lift.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I have just been promoted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! what was that to a man of your merit,
with a Senator to speak at court for you? A petty
first lieutenancy is nothing for a brilliant fellow like
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not half so brilliant a fellow as you declare,
and I think that a commission as first lieutenant
is a big thing for a young man like me. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
sure I never had an idea of being an officer at all;
and, when I was made a sergeant, I didn&#8217;t think I
deserved it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose a major-general can
want with you? You have heard from Senator
Guilford once before, and I am satisfied you will
hear from him again. Now, Somers, what do you
suppose the general wants of you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I think it very likely he wants a
man of my size to go up the river, or on the other
side, scouting; nothing more than that, I am satisfied.
But I must obey the order,&#8221; added Somers,
who had been making his preparations during the
conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-by, my boy; and I shall have to
stand one side for you after this, and salute you as
major.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Major.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How absurd you are, captain! You always
talk like a sensible fellow; that is, when you mean
what you say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A hard hit; and very likely the first thing you
do, when you get to be a major, will be to arrest
me for lying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hit is the hardest, my dear captain. We
have seen some hard times together; and you may
be sure that whatever I am, I shall never forget
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s hearty, my boy! Your hand once
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
more,&#8221; replied De Banyan, extending his own.
&#8220;After the battle of Solferino&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, captain, you must excuse me this time,
or the general will put me under arrest for my
want of promptness, instead of sending me on
special duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good luck to you, Somers,&#8221; said the captain
as the lieutenant started for the division headquarters.
</p>
<p>As he passed out of sight, an expression of sadness
settled down upon Captain de Banyan&#8217;s face.
He looked disappointed and uncomfortable, and it
is quite probable that he envied the good fortune
of his young companion in arms. If Somers had
been brave, and attentive to his duty, he had been
no less so himself; and he could not help feeling
that the destruction of those railroad cars had
made the young man&#8217;s fortune; that his rapid advancement
was a mere stroke of good luck.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Somers, wondering what could possibly
be wanted of him, hastened to the headquarters
of the division. He had no faith whatever in
the prognostications of Captain de Banyan, and
was too modest to believe that he had done anything
to merit another promotion so soon. Recalling
the incidents of his career since his eventful
expedition within the rebel lines, there was
nothing in his conduct to merit even the notice of
his superiors, unless it was what others called his
skill and courage in rallying the broken company
at Glendale. He had been warmly praised for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
this act; but he deemed it of little importance, for
the memory of Williamsburg cast into the shade
anything that had occurred to him since that bloody
day.
</p>
<p>He was ushered into the presence of the general,
who gave him the kindly welcome which he always
bestowed upon those of humble rank. Now,
Somers cherished an intense admiration for this
distinguished officer, and esteemed it a greater
honor to stand in his presence than in that of the
most powerful sovereign of the earth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Somers?&#8221; said the general, extending
his hand; a piece of condescension which made
our officer blush, and appear as awkward as a
country school-boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; thank you, sir,&#8221; stammered Somers,
as he took the proffered hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You behaved well at Glendale, Somers,&#8221; said
the general bluntly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I endeavored to do my duty, general.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did well on that scout, too; and I&#8217;m going
to send you out on another, if you have any fancy
for such work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do the best I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my brave fellow, I wish you to be very
careful; for we can&#8217;t afford to lose officers like
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am always careful, general,&#8221; said Somers
with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you handle a boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I was brought up among boats.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You will go over the river. There is rebel
cavalry over there, and very likely a considerable
force of infantry. I am inclined to think they are
building batteries in the woods, to close up the
navigation of the river, or perhaps to shell us out
of our position. In a word, I am instructed to
solve the problem, and I have selected you to do
the work. What do you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all ready, sir, to undertake that, or any
service to which I may be ordered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the right spirit, Captain Somers; and
I thank you for the promptness with which you
enter into my plans. I am satisfied, captain, that
you will discharge the duty to my entire satisfaction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Captain Somers, you shall take what
force you think necessary. As it will not be prudent
for you to go over before dark, you may make
up your plan, and I will listen to the details before
you go. How many boats shall you want,
captain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one, sir,&#8221; replied Somers promptly;
though he was wondering with all his might how
the general happened to make so many blunders
in regard to his military title, for he had called
him captain four or five times.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one? You will need force enough to protect
you, captain,&#8221; replied the general.
</p>
<p>Captain again!
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not intend to fight the whole rebel army,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
if it is over there. I do not propose to take more
than half a dozen men with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is a sensible view of the enterprise;
for the more men you take, the greater your
chances of being discovered. Select your own men,
Captain Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Captain Somers! The general had certainly
forgotten that he was only a first lieutenant, or
else he was amusing himself at his modest subordinate&#8217;s
expense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know of several men in our regiment who are
just what I want,&#8221; replied Somers, hardly able to
speak from embarrassment, on account of the general&#8217;s
often-repeated mistake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; you shall have the necessary authority
to select whom you please. You may go
now, and arrange your plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers saluted the general, and was about to
retire, when the thought occurred to him that he
might at least gratify his friend Captain de Banyan,
and perhaps bring him favorably to the general&#8217;s
notice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I be allowed to select an officer to go with
me?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, if you desire; but you will remember
that you are a young officer, going out on difficult
and dangerous service, and that officers will
not be so obedient as privates,&#8221; suggested the general.
&#8220;Whom do you desire to go with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan, of our regiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain! Why, then he will be your equal in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
rank, and by priority of commission, your superior.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall agree remarkably well, general,
though he is my superior in rank, without regard
to dates,&#8221; replied Somers, who by this time had
come to the conclusion that the general meant
something by calling him captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you are both captains,&#8221; added the general
with apparent indifference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, general; you have probably
forgotten that the commission which was forwarded
to me only about two weeks ago was that
of first lieutenant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember all about it, Captain Somers; but,
by the time you reach your quarters, there will be
another commission there for you. By the way,
captain, do you remember Senator Guilford?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, general; I have good reason to remember
him; for he takes a deep interest in my affairs,&#8221; replied
Somers, whose brown face was red with
blushes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has a pretty daughter, hasn&#8217;t he? Fell out of
a railroad car and broke her arm, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the only time I ever saw her, general,&#8221;
stammered Somers; &#8220;and probably I shall
never see her again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are as cold-blooded as a frog! Why
don&#8217;t you write to the damsel, and tell her you are
still alive, if you can&#8217;t think of anything else to
say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to curry favor with great folks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I like that, captain. But you must attend to
your duty now. You may have Captain de&mdash;what&#8217;s-his-name&mdash;if
you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan, sir. He is a brave and
noble fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I remember him. He is certainly a brave
fellow; for I noticed him at Glendale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At Oak Grove he captured the enemy&#8217;s sharpshooters,
who were lodged in the old house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you did that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I was under Captain de Banyan&#8217;s
orders at the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see; and I will remember that, Captain
Somers. By the way, it would be well for you to
write to Senator Guilford, just to inform him of
your promotion. He has done good service for
you, though I have no hesitation in saying your
promotion would have been certain without his
aid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, general,&#8221; replied Somers, who
fully understood the meaning of that significant
remark.
</p>
<p>We regret that the good conduct of our hero has
destroyed the fitness of the title which we had
chosen for our humble volume; but we will venture
to say that our sympathizing readers will rejoice
with him in his advancement.
</p>
<p>Captain Somers! The idea seemed to him as big
as a mountain, when he withdrew from the presence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
of the general, who evidently experienced a
deep satisfaction in the result of his recommendation
to the authorities, and had humorously chosen
this method of communicating the welcome news.
The earth seemed to be as elastic as India-rubber
under the feet of the new-made captain, as he
hastened back to the camp of the regiment.
</p>
<p>He could hardly believe his senses; it was so
strange that a young man like him should attain
to this high rank. He wanted to &#8220;crow;&#8221; and perhaps
he would have done so, if he had not considered
that he must maintain the dignity of his
new office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Somers, I greet you!&#8221; exclaimed De
Banyan on his return to camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you I was a captain?&#8221; laughed
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This document,&#8221; replied he, handing him the
ponderous official envelope. &#8220;I congratulate you,
my boy; though I&#8217;m rather disappointed to find
you are not a major.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, captain! I would have declined a
major&#8217;s commission.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Declined it!&#8221; gasped De Banyan. &#8220;Well, I
don&#8217;t know but you would. You are the only
officer I ever knew to decline a glass of wine, and I
don&#8217;t know but you would decline a major&#8217;s commission.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly would. Why, I&#8217;m only a boy; and
I don&#8217;t know but I ought to decline even a captain&#8217;s
commission. I&#8217;m only eighteen years old.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What of that? There&#8217;s the Fourth Vermont
over there&mdash;the colonel of that regiment isn&#8217;t
twenty-one yet, and there isn&#8217;t a better or braver
officer in the army. If you decline, I&#8217;ll cross you
off from my list of friends. Why, at Balaclava,
when I was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Balaclava and blarney!&#8221; exclaimed Somers
impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only going to say, that I was but seventeen
when I was made a captain in the British
army.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a brigadier in my own imagination,
just as you were a captain, when you were seventeen.
But never mind that; I am going on a scout;
have got my orders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my boy! you are going to celebrate the
arrival of your commission by active duty. I wish
the generals would think of me when they want
something handsome done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say to going with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would thank my stars for the chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then I have orders for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, my dear fellow, you touch my heart-strings!&#8221;
cried the captain, jumping up, and
throwing his arms around Somers in the most extravagant
manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On one condition,&#8221; added Captain Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any condition you please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are my superior; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know all about it. I will go as a volunteer,
and you shall command the expedition.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We will work together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With all my heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers then selected six men for the service,
with special reference to their skill as boatmen, and
ordered them to make the necessary preparations
for duty. As there were still several hours to spare
before dark, he used a portion of this time in writing
a letter to his mother, informing her of the remarkable
fortune that had attended him; and another
to Senator Guilford, thanking him for the
kind interest he had manifested in his welfare, in
the postscript of which he wrote the history of Captain
de Banyan&#8217;s valuable services, and modestly
added that any favor conferred on his friend would
ever be gratefully remembered by the writer.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>OVER THE RIVER</h3>
</div>

<p>Captain Somers, as we are hereafter to call
him, was proud and happy in the distinction which
had been bestowed upon him; but he had some
doubts whether he had fully earned his promotion.
He had done as much as any, and more than some.
Yet it seemed to him just as though nothing short
of the capture or annihilation of a whole brigade
of the enemy&#8217;s forces could entitle him to such a
distinguished honor, especially as he was only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
eighteen years of age. He was afraid that Senator
Guilford had exerted too much influence in his
favor; but the general of the division had assured
him he had won his promotion, and would have
received it in time, even without the powerful aid
of the honorable gentleman at Washington.
</p>
<p>This thought comforted him; and he only hoped
that his friend De Banyan would be as highly
favored as he had been. The valiant captain, in
spite of his glaring faults, was a good fellow, a
fine officer, and very popular with his inferiors as
well as his superiors. He had become very much
attached to Somers, and had proved by many substantial
acts that he was animated by a warm regard
for him. Though he talked a great deal
about the favor of high officials in securing his promotion,
he had never hinted a wish that Somers
should attempt to influence his powerful friend to
do anything for him.
</p>
<p>Somers said nothing to the captain about the
letter he had written. If anything was done, he
wished to have his friend surprised as he had been.
But he had only slight hopes that anything would
be accomplished by his application. Though Captain
de Banyan had always behaved well in battle,
and had always faithfully discharged his duties
in the camp and on the march, there was something
like a mystery hanging about him, which had a
tendency to prejudice the officers against him.
While they admired his bravery, and enjoyed his
society, there was a certain lack of confidence, resulting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
from a want of knowledge of his antecedents.
</p>
<p>De Banyan always evaded any allusion to his
former residence or occupation. He desired to be
regarded as a soldier of fortune, who had fought
with every nation that had a quarrel with its neighbors.
Where he was born, where he had lived, or
how he obtained his commission, were secrets
locked up in his own breast. Somers had some
doubts in regard to him, and was constantly afraid
that he should hear more of the captain than it
would be pleasant to know.
</p>
<p>Captain Somers reported his arrangements in
due form to the general, and they were approved.
About nine o&#8217;clock in the evening, he, with his little
party, embarked on the river, and the rowers
pulled towards the opposite shore. Of course, it
was necessary to use the utmost caution; for a rebel
picket on the opposite bank of the river might suddenly
put an end to the career of some of the party.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are making a mistake, Captain
Somers,&#8221; said De Banyan in a whisper, when they
had gone about half way across the river.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I; but it is not too late to correct the
error,&#8221; replied Somers, as he turned the bow of
the boat down the river.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are my double, Somers; for you
know my thoughts before I utter them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just thinking, when you spoke, that we
were running into a nest of the enemy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just before the battle of the Alma, I went on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
just such an expedition as this; but we went down
the river beyond the enemy&#8217;s lines, and doubled up
in the rear of them; thus finding out all we wanted
to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I propose to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Brickfield and myself landed, and
walked sixty-four miles between nine o&#8217;clock in the
evening and four o&#8217;clock in the morning,&#8221; added
Captain de Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixty-four miles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Somers. &#8220;Did you walk
all the way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every step.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was tip-top walking, De Banyan&mdash;a little
more than nine miles an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you doubt the story?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt that it is a story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that isn&#8217;t kind of you, Somers, to be perpetually
throwing discredit upon everything I
say,&#8221; replied the captain, apparently much hurt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say such things, then. You don&#8217;t
expect any man in his senses to believe that you
walked over nine miles an hour, and followed it for
seven hours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was tougher then than I am now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you can tell a tougher story now than you
could then, I&#8217;ll warrant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my dear fellow, I&#8217;m afraid you will die
with an enormous fib in your mouth.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Somers, you are taking a mean advantage
of my friendship. You know that I like
you too well to quarrel with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; said Somers earnestly. &#8220;There is a
boat coming out from the rebel side of the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The water was covered with vessels of every description
in the vicinity of Harrison&#8217;s Landing;
and the boat had just emerged from this forest of
masts and smokestacks. It was time to be entirely
silent again; for the rebels were on the alert in
every direction, watching to strike a blow at the
grand army, or to pick up individual stragglers
who might fall in their way. The boat which
Somers had discovered was approaching from the
rebel side of the river; and to be seen by the enemy,
at this point of the proceedings, would be fatal to
the expedition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; said a man in the rebel boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are ye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tones were so unmistakably Southern, that
there could be no question in regard to the party
to which the boat belonged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Officers examining the enemy&#8217;s lines,&#8221; replied
Somers.
</p>
<p>At the same time he ordered his crew to pull,
and steered the boat so as to run her alongside the
other. On the way, he whispered to the men his
instructions; and, as soon as they were near
enough, they leaped on board the rebel boat, and
captured her astonished crew before they had time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
to make any resistance. No doubt they thought
this was very rude treatment to receive from the
hands of those who professed to be their friends;
but they had discovered their mistake by this time,
and it afforded a sufficient explanation of the
seeming inconsistency.
</p>
<p>The capture of this boat involved the necessity
of returning to the nearest steamer in the river to
dispose of the prisoners. On the way back, Somers
and De Banyan conversed with the rebels on general
topics; for the latter refused to say anything
which could be of service to their enemy. After
the captives had been delivered on board the
steamer, our party decided to take the boat which
had been captured, instead of the one they had
brought from the landing; for there were some
peculiarities in its construction, which made it a
safer conveyance in rebel waters than the other,
the approach of which would excite suspicion if
seen.
</p>
<p>Again they pulled down the river, and passed the
point from beyond which the rebel boat had approached
them. The shore was probably lined with
pickets; and the wisdom of exchanging the boats
was now more apparent to them than before.
Somers steered into a little inlet or bay beyond the
point, and at the head of it found a creek flowing
into the river. It was wide and deep at the outlet;
and he decided to ascend it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How was it, Andy?&#8221; said a voice from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
shore, after the boat had advanced a few rods up
the creek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; replied Somers at a venture;
though he was somewhat startled by the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the Yankees any picket boats out?&#8221; demanded
the man on shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far up have you been?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About two miles,&#8221; answered Somers, continually
coughing to account for any change in his
voice which might be apparent to his friend on
shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fire-steamer is all ready,&#8221; added the voice;
&#8220;and it is about time to go to work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fire-steamer!&#8221; exclaimed Somers in a low
tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to burn the vessels in the
river,&#8221; added De Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must stop their fun at all hazards,&#8221; replied
the valiant captain promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you stopping there for, Andy? Why
don&#8217;t you pull up the creek?&#8221; continued the man
on shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name isn&#8217;t Andy,&#8221; said Somers; &#8220;and I
don&#8217;t fully understand this business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, then?&#8221; replied the rebel. &#8220;What
has become of Andy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has got another job, and sent me to do this
one,&#8221; answered Somers, whose ready wit had
adopted a plan to defeat the purpose of the enemy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Leathers. Andy sent me up to attend to
this matter. Where is the fire-steamer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About half a mile farther up the creek. But
where is Andy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some general sent for him; and he has gone to
Richmond. I reckon the iron-clad&#8217;s coming down
soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you take care of the steamer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a pilot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pilot enough for this business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand it all. Andy was afraid to do
this job, and has backed out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know what he said to me,&#8221; replied
Somers innocently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, pull up the creek, and don&#8217;t waste any
more time in talking about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t wasted any time. You have done all
the talking yourself,&#8221; replied Somers, who thought
he should not be a consistent Southerner if he did
not growl.
</p>
<p>Somers directed the men to pull again, and the
boat advanced up the creek till the steamer appeared.
She was a small, worn-out old craft,
which had probably dodged into the creek when the
Union fleet came up the river. The man who had
spoken from the shore reached the place almost
as soon as the boat. He was dressed in the gray
of the Confederate army, and was evidently an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
officer detailed to perform the duty of fitting out
the fire-ship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a most remarkable proceeding on the
part of the pilot,&#8221; said the officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it. You needn&#8217;t growl at me about
it. If you don&#8217;t want me, I don&#8217;t want the job,&#8221;
replied Somers sourly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be impudent to me,&#8221; added the officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t you be impudent to me,&#8221; said
Somers. &#8220;I&#8217;m not one of your men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence! or I shall put you under arrest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the channel of the river?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do. What do you suppose Andy
sent me here for?&#8221; snarled Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a civil tongue in your head, man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better show me how to do it first.
Come, Graves,&#8221; he added, turning to De Banyan,
&#8220;we are not wanted here, and we will go home
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that man with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Graves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get all these men?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They came with me to see the fun, and help the
thing along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officer stepped on board of the steamer, and
Somers and De Banyan joined him on the deck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve seen you somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think very likely; I was there once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a crusty young cub; but it may be
you know your duty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do; and as for being crusty, I
treated you like a gentleman till you began to snarl
at me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, my friend, we will rub out the past
and begin again,&#8221; said the officer pleasantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With all my heart, if you say so,&#8221; replied
Somers with equal suavity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very important enterprise, and we
want to teach the Yankees that it will be better
for them to stay at home next time they want to
come down South. What is your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Leathers. What&#8217;s yours? Andy told
me; but I&#8217;ve forgotten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Osborn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rebel officer proceeded to give the supposed
pilot very full instructions in regard to the steamer,
which was to be run up the river to City Point, set
on fire, and then abandoned to float with the current
through the thickest of the Federal fleet, blowing
up gunboats, and consuming transports by the
hundred. The fire-steamer had been loaded with
pitch-wood, tar, pitch and turpentine; and Captain
Osborn was satisfied that the plan, if thoroughly
carried out, would cause tremendous havoc
among the Yankee vessels. He rubbed his hands
with delight as he contemplated the prospect of
driving the &#8220;Hessian&#8221; fleet from the river, and
starving the Union army out of its position.
</p>
<p>An engineer and two firemen, whom they found
on board the steamer, were all the crew she had,
and all she needed besides the pilot. They had got
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
up steam, and the vessel was all ready to move on
her errand of destruction when the word should
be given.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you are all ready,&#8221; said Captain Osborn
when he had completed his instructions. &#8220;You
will hoist the American flag, and pretend you are
a Yankee, if they attempt to stop you on your way
up the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do that to a charm,&#8221; replied Somers.
&#8220;I am all ready. Where is Graves? Hallo,
Graves!&#8221; he shouted, when he found that his companion
had left his side to take a look at the other
parts of the steamer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am, Tom,&#8221; answered Graves, emerging
from the engine-room, where he had been talking
with the presiding genius of that department.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run up the colors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, sir!&#8221; replied De Banyan.
</p>
<p>The colors went up, and other preparations were
made for the great enterprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cast off that stern line!&#8221; said Somers. &#8220;Make
fast your painter on the port quarter,&#8221; he added
to the man in the boat; and no doubt by this time
Captain Osborn was fully satisfied that he was perfectly
familiar with the management of a steamer.
</p>
<p>Now, Somers was very well satisfied that he
should run the steamer aground before he rounded
the first point in the river, and he had wisely concluded
not to undertake so rash an enterprise. Besides,
he did not come over there to be the skipper
of a steamer; he had other and even more important
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
duties to perform. He was much more interested
in certain rebel batteries which were believed
to be in process of construction farther up
the river. But Captain Osborn was an unreasonable
man, and demanded the execution of his plan.
He was determined to see a conflagration, and
Somers was equally determined to gratify him.
</p>
<p>Our pilot discovered the value of his limited
nautical experience in Pinchbrook Harbor; for it
enabled him to convince the rebel officer that he
was a full-fledged &#8220;salt,&#8221; and was entirely at home
on the deck of any vessel that could float in the
waters of the James. The stern-line and the bow-line
were cast off; and Somers stood in the little
wheel-house, ready to ring the bells. Captain
Osborn had just stepped on shore, intending to
mount his horse and ride up the river, where he
could see the conflagration when it came off.
</p>
<p>Just then, there was a tremendous commotion
among the firemen and engineer; and, a moment
later, a broad, bright sheet of flame rose from the
heap of combustibles in the after-part of the
steamer.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN DE BANYAN FINDS AN OLD FRIEND</h3>
</div>

<p>Both Somers and De Banyan flew to the rescue,
and made a most enthusiastic attempt to check
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
the fire; but the raging element was now past control.
The flames spread through the combustible
material which had been stored on the deck; and
they were compelled to abandon the ill-starred
steamer with the utmost precipitation, in order to
save their own lives.
</p>
<p>De Banyan had rolled up an old newspaper,
making of it a kind of torch, some three feet in
length, which he had inserted in a mass of pitch-wood
shavings, and set the end on fire. It had
burned long enough to remove suspicion from him;
and, when the pilot and crew went on shore, Captain
Osborn had no idea of the trick of which he
had been made the victim. Our scouts kept up appearances
in the most remarkable manner, and
Somers was only afraid that his zealous companion
would overdo the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that, Captain Osborn?&#8221;
demanded Somers, as he shook the cinders from
his clothes in the presence of the rebel officer.
&#8220;Did you intend to sacrifice our lives?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; burn us up before we had time to leave
the old hulk!&#8221; added De Banyan furiously. &#8220;I
thought we were to light the fire ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; replied Captain Osborn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t? Who did do it, then?&#8221; persisted
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know; but, in my opinion, you
did it yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an idiot! Do you think I would destroy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
the work of my own hands?&#8221; added the rebel
warmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I supposed you fired the train so as to be
sure the thing was done right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a fool, or else you didn&#8217;t suppose any
such thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know but what you had one of those
clock machines, that touch a thing off at a certain
time. Well, how did it happen, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; perhaps from a spark from the
fire. No matter how it was done now. It is done,
and can&#8217;t be helped. I have lost the satisfaction of
seeing half the Yankee fleet burnt up. I would
rather have given a year&#8217;s pay than have had this
accident happen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t they got most ready for the Yankee
fleet above here?&#8221; asked Somers as carelessly as he
could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are building batteries up above, to knock
the Yankees into pieces, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Captain Osborn, I don&#8217;t believe your
plan would have succeeded if the steamer hadn&#8217;t
caught afire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you? Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose the Yankees had stopped us on our
way up, and come on board the steamer. Don&#8217;t
you think they would have known what she was
for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they would.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they would. Why didn&#8217;t you fit out
your steamer up the river?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t so many steamers that we can
afford to burn them up. We took this one because
she happened to be in the creek, where the Yankees
could capture her at any time they pleased.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t need a steamer above the fleet; a
raft would do just as well. I think I shall go up
the river, and see what can be done. Well, boys,&#8221;
added Somers to the men in the boat, &#8220;there will
be no fun to-night, and you may as well go home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As this order was in conformity with previous
instructions, the men pulled down the creek to its
mouth, where they could remain concealed till their
officers returned.
</p>
<p>By the light of the burning steamer, Captain
Osborn had attentively scanned the features of the
pilot and his companion, apparently for the purpose
of determining where he had seen the former.
As they had both dressed themselves for the occasion,
they submitted to his scrutiny without fear.
When he had finished his survey, he mounted his
horse, which was fastened to a tree near the creek,
and had become very restive as the glaring fire
scattered burning cinders near him. As the rider
had no further use for our enterprising operatives,
he bestowed no further notice upon them, and rode
off to report to his commanding officer the failure
of the hopeful enterprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have done some good by coming over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
here,&#8221; said Captain de Banyan as the officer galloped
up the road above the creek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, captain!&#8221; replied Somers. &#8220;You forget
where you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t; we are alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not; the trees have ears sometimes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where are you going now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up the river. We will take a walk up to the
batteries, if there are any there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They proceeded in the direction indicated for
about three miles without being molested, or even
challenged by a sentinel. The Army of the Potomac
had been on the other side of the river nearly
a month, and had ceased to be a curiosity to the
rebel inhabitants in the vicinity; and like sensible
people, as they were in this respect if in no other,
they devoted the hours of darkness to sleep. On
the shore opposite the camp, they found a battery
of artillery. Rude field-works had been constructed
near the water, on which the guns of the
company had been placed. Our travelers were too
modest to make the acquaintance of the rebels, and
kept at a respectful distance from them, crawling
on the ground near enough to ascertain the force
of the enemy.
</p>
<p>Taking to the fields for greater safety, the scouts
went up the river several miles farther, without
making any discoveries worthy of notice. The object
of the excursion had been fully accomplished;
and they began to retrace their steps towards the
creek, where the boat was waiting their return.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
When we are well employed, time passes away very
rapidly; and our adventurers had taken no note
of its passage. Before they had made a single
mile, the bright streaks of day in the east warned
them that they had remained too long for their own
safety.
</p>
<p>The prospect of being examined by rebel officers
in broad daylight was not pleasant; and, increasing
their speed, they walked by the shortest way towards
the creek. When they had passed the battery
of artillery, they abandoned the fields, through
which they could make but slow progress, for the
road. They had three miles farther to go, and it
was now nearly sunrise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we must have lost two or three hours,&#8221;
said Somers as they hastened on their way. &#8220;I
had no idea that it was more than two o&#8217;clock in
the morning when we turned about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; replied De Banyan. &#8220;We must have
spent two or three hours in crawling on the ground
about that battery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see where the time is all gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It goes fast when we are busy. When I was in
the Crimea&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the Crimea now,&#8221; protested
Somers, who was in no mood for his companion&#8217;s
fibs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be crusty, Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not mean to be crusty; but you know my
opinion about those stories of the Crimea and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
Italian war, and I don&#8217;t think it is a good plan to
talk so much over here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please; it is your turn to speak next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant no offense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you didn&#8217;t, Somers; but you reproved
me, and I can only hold my peace; for you are the
commander of this expedition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I like you as a brother; but I don&#8217;t
like those silly yarns about your impossible achievements.
Hark! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This last remark was caused by the sound of
horses&#8217; feet behind them; and our travelers looked
back with eager interest to ascertain what was approaching.
It was a body of cavalry, which had
just swept round a bend of the road, and was now
in plain sight of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do,&#8221; said De Banyan with energy.
&#8220;We must conceal ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they have seen us, and we may as well
make the best of it. If we hide, they will certainly
suspect us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have not seen us yet. They are half a
mile off,&#8221; replied the captain, as he retired to the
field by the side of the road.
</p>
<p>Somers followed him, though he did not fully
approve the policy of his friend. They walked a
short distance till they came to a covert of bushes,
in which they concealed themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have made a mistake. The dog always
bites when you attempt to run away from
him,&#8221; said Somers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they saw us,&#8221; persisted De Banyan.
&#8220;If they did, we can tell as good a story
here as we could in the road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I always believe in facing the music. I have
found that impudence will carry a man a great
deal farther and a great deal faster than his legs
can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right, Somers. When I was
in Italy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! Don&#8217;t say Italy or Crimea again till
we reach the other side of the river,&#8221; interposed
Somers, who was too seriously affected by the
perils of their situation to be willing to listen to
any of his companion&#8217;s hallucinations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you please, Somers,&#8221; answered the captain,
unmoved by the rebuff; &#8220;but, when I was
doing scout duty before the battle of Magenta, I
saw the advance of the Austrians coming up behind
me. I crawled into a haystack, and remained there
while the whole army of the Austrians, about four
hundred thousand men, passed by me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers could not but smile at the infatuation of
his friend, who at such a perilous moment could
indulge in such a vicious practice as that of inventing
great stories. He did not even ask him how
long it took the Austrian army to pass the haystack,
whether they had haystacks in Italy, nor if
it was probable that such an army would pass
over a single road. He waited patiently, or impatiently,
for the approach of the rebel cavalry,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
which soon reached the road near the bushes where
they were hidden.
</p>
<p>To his consternation, they came to a dead halt;
and he could see the men gazing earnestly in the
direction they had retired. Then half a dozen of
the troopers entered the field, and rode directly
towards the covert of bushes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are caught!&#8221; whispered Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Just after the battle of Palestro,
when I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush it is,&#8221; replied De Banyan, as coolly as
though he had been under his shelter tent on the
other side of the James.
</p>
<p>Taking a knife from his pocket, he began to cut
away at a straight bush which grew near him, and
was thus busily employed when the soldiers
reached the spot. Somers stretched himself on the
ground, and waited the issue of the event; deciding
to let his companion, who had got him into the
scrape, extricate him from it. The coolness of the
captain, and the peculiar manner he assumed, convinced
him that he had some resources upon which
to draw in this trying emergency.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo, there!&#8221; shouted one of the troopers
savagely, as though he intended to carry consternation
in the tones of his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, old hoss?&#8221; inquired De Banyan,
as impudently as though he had been the lord of
the manor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What ye doin&#8217; in here?&#8221; demanded the horseman,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
as he forced his animal into the bushes far
enough to obtain a full view of both of the
fugitives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, old hoss, if Heaven gin you two eyes,
what were they gin to ye fur?&#8221; replied the captain,
still hacking away at the sapling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye run for when you saw us coming?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t run.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yer did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know best, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye come in here fur?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ye see what I came in here for?&#8221; replied
De Banyan, as he finished cutting off the bush, and
proceeded to trim off the branches.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, old hoss, I&#8217;m the brother of my father&#8217;s
oldest son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s yer name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t got any; had a difficulty with the district
attorney in our county, and lost it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out here, and show yerself. The cap&#8217;n
wants to see yer down to the road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just goin&#8217; down there. Say, you hain&#8217;t got a
spare hoss in your caravan, have you? I&#8217;m gettin&#8217;
amazin&#8217; tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out, both of you. I can&#8217;t stay here all
day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t wait for me; I&#8217;m in no hurry,&#8221; answered
the captain, as he slowly emerged from the
bushes, followed by Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I shall wait for yer; and, if yer don&#8217;t step
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
along lively, I&#8217;ll let yer know how this cheese-knife
feels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t distress yourself to do anything of the
sort,&#8221; said De Banyan; and he hobbled along on
his new-made cane.
</p>
<p>A walk of a few rods brought them to the road,
where the commander of the company was impatiently
awaiting their arrival. He looked daggers
at the travelers, and evidently intended to annihilate
them by the fierceness of his visage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give an account of yourself,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re no account,&#8221; replied De Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you before,&#8221; continued the cavalry
commander, gazing intently at the captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you saw me behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like you. Why, really, it is Barney
Marvel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; demanded De Banyan with an expression
of humor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barney Marvel! Don&#8217;t you know your own
name? Give us your hand, Barney,&#8221; added the
officer, as he extended his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, cap&#8217;n, perhaps I&#8217;m Barney what&#8217;s-his-name;
but, &#8217;pon my word, I don&#8217;t think I am;&#8221;
and De Banyan wore a troubled expression, even
to the eyes of his anxious companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be modest about it, Barney. You left us
rather unceremoniously; but I hope you&#8217;ll be able
to show that it was all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my word it was all right, though I
haven&#8217;t the least idea what you mean.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you, indeed, Barney?&#8221; laughed the
captain, who, in spite of his present happy manner,
was evidently as much puzzled as the other party.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my word, I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say you are not Barney Marvel,
formerly a lieutenant in the Third Tennessee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I understood your position, Barney;
but I advise you not to deny facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never deny facts, captain; you haven&#8217;t told
me your name yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No need of that. Now, be honest, Barney.
Tell us all about it. There wasn&#8217;t an officer in the
regiment that didn&#8217;t mourn you as a brother when
you left us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very much obliged to them,&#8221; replied De
Banyan lightly; but even Somers began to have
some doubts in regard to his popular friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are Magenta, Solferino, and the Crimea,
now-a-days?&#8221; demanded the officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard of such places. Don&#8217;t know much
about geography,&#8221; answered the captain.
</p>
<p>Somers was confounded when the officer repeated
these words, which was proof positive that
he was the man whom the captain represented him
to be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sergeant, dismount, and tell me if you find B.
M. on that man&#8217;s right arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sergeant obeyed, and, with the assistance of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
another, bared the captain&#8217;s arm, where they
found, plainly marked in India ink, the initials
B. M.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE THIRD TENNESSEE</h3>
</div>

<p>Probably there was no one in either party who
was so thoroughly bewildered by the incident which
had just transpired as Captain Somers. The mystery
of his companion&#8217;s antecedents was in a fair
way to be cleared up, though in a very unsatisfactory
manner to those most intimately concerned.
The conversation, and the verification of the rebel
officer&#8217;s statements, showed that De Banyan was
not De Banyan; that the brave and brilliant Federal
officer was not a Federal officer; that, of all he
had been, only the &#8220;brave&#8221; and &#8220;brilliant&#8221; remained.
</p>
<p>It was painfully evident that the bold and dashing
captain was, or had been, a rebel officer.
Somers was terribly shocked at the discovery, even
while it was a satisfaction to have the mystery of
his companion&#8217;s previous life explained. For the
time, he forgot the perils of his own situation in
the interest he felt in the affairs of his friend. Perhaps
De Banyan was a spy, who had been serving
in the Union army for the purpose of conveying information
to the enemy. He had been very glad
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
of the opportunity to cross the river; and it seemed
probable to our hero that he wished to return to
his friends. It is true, the efficient services of the
captain in the Army of the Potomac, his readiness
at all times to fight the rebels, and especially his
shooting down the enemy&#8217;s pickets in the swamp,
were not exactly consistent with such a record; but
perhaps he had done these things to keep up appearances,
and thus enable him the better to promote
the objects of the rebellion.
</p>
<p>He was anxious to hear the captain&#8217;s explanation
of these gross charges; but, of course, that was
utterly impracticable at present. In the meantime,
there was no room to doubt that the cavalry
officer had all the truth on his side. He had hinted
very strongly that De Banyan was a deserter; but
he might have deserted for the purpose of performing
the special duty which had been assigned to
him. Officers and soldiers, sent out as spies, had
often incurred the odium of such a reputation, in
order to keep their own counsels, and serve their
country the more faithfully.
</p>
<p>If Captain de Banyan was a deserter in appearance
only, he would, of course, soon be able to
make his fidelity and patriotism apparent to the
rebel authorities; and being a patriot, in the
traitor use of the word, he could not do less than
denounce his companion as a Federal spy. Whatever
turn the affair might take, Somers felt that his
own chances of escape were every moment becoming
beautifully less. If De Banyan was a faithful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
rebel, there was proof positive that his companion
was a spy; if not, he was in the company of a deserter,
and would be subjected to all manner of
suspicion.
</p>
<p>De Banyan still held his head up, and did not
lose his impudence, even after the letters had been
found upon his arm. He did not appear to be at
all confused by the discovery and the triumph of
the cavalry officer&#8217;s argument. He punched
Somers in the side with his elbow; but the latter
was unable to divine the significance of this movement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Barney, I wish somebody else had caught
you instead of me; for it is not pleasant to find an
old friend under such circumstances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, captain, I haven&#8217;t the pleasure of
knowing your name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Barney, don&#8217;t keep up this farce any
longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about to beg the favor, that you would
not call me by that offensive name any longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be changing your colors very
rapidly,&#8221; laughed the officer. &#8220;When I first saw
you, you were a rough-spoken fellow; but now you
use the language of a polished gentleman. Barney,
you and I were good friends in the Third Tennessee;
and, though I am sorry to meet you under
these circumstances, we must both make the best
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, captain, you are entirely mistaken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
in your man. I never was in Tennessee in my
life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! You were always celebrated for monstrous
stories; and they are fully in keeping with
your past history. Well, since you refuse to recognize
an old friend, of course I shall be excused for
any unpleasant measures to which I may be compelled
to resort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything you please, captain, so long as you
refrain from calling me Barney, which in my estimation
is a low and vulgar cognomen, that I am
unwilling to have applied to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the man with you?&#8221; demanded the
officer in more business-like tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Tom Leathers; he&#8217;s a pilot on the
James. We refer you to Captain Osborn for evidence
of our character. We came here to do a job
for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then. Captain Osborn lodges at the
next house on this road, and we will let him speak
for the other man. He can&#8217;t speak for you; for I
know you better than he does, or any other man
who has not served in the Third Tennessee. As
you were going this way, you can walk along with
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the polite invitation, and this
is a handsome escort for a man of my humble
pretensions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The captain of the company ordered his men to
keep back, and Somers and De Banyan walked by
the side of his horse, a few yards in advance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
platoons. He had evidently adopted this method
to draw out his prisoners; for as such our officers
were compelled to regard themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marvel, you used to be a very sensible fellow
when you were in the Third Tennessee,&#8221; said the
rebel captain. &#8220;I am surprised to see you adopting
such a stupid method to conceal your identity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had good reasons for it,&#8221; replied De Banyan,
casting his eyes behind him, as if to assure himself
that none of the soldiers were within hearing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What reasons?&#8221; asked the officer curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think a man of your discretion would
easily understand the reason, without any explanation.
If I am to be tried for any offense, I don&#8217;t
want to be judged by a whole company of cavalry.
You know I always took pride in my reputation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to think so; but, when we missed you
one day, we got rid of that opinion in the Third
Tennessee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you wronged me; for I have faithfully
served my country from that day to this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it, and I hope you will be able
to prove what you have said. How came you
here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came over from the other side of the river
last night. You intimated that my departure from
the Third was not all regular,&#8221; added the captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a word, it was understood that you had
deserted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to hear it; but you will remember
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
that your loyalty to the Southern Confederacy
was not above suspicion when you joined the
regiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>De Banyan punched Somers with his elbow at
these words, as though he wished him to take particular
notice of them; but his admiring friend
needed no such admonition to induce him to give
strict attention to the statement, for it was the
most satisfactory remark he had heard during the
interview. Captain de Banyan rose twenty-five
per cent in his estimation at the utterance of those
words, however injurious they were in the opinion
of him who had spoken them. There was hope for
the captain; and Somers trusted that he would be
able fully to exonerate himself from the foul
charge, when the occasion should permit such an
exposition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My loyalty ought to be considered above suspicion,
and those who know me best do so regard
it,&#8221; added De Banyan as he administered another
mild punch on the ribs of his fellow-sufferer. &#8220;I
was taken by the Yankees, in short; and, at the
first convenient opportunity, I have come over to
see you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it is all right, Barney; but I am afraid
it is not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be able to clear myself of every imputation
of disloyalty, before the proper tribunal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get over?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been following the fortunes of the
Yankee army till last night; when I took a boat,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
and came over the river. On the way I met a pilot
whose name was Andy, who turned me over to this
man, who is also a pilot, and came down to take
out a fire-ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The one that was burned in the creek last
night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same. I refer you to Captain Osborn for
the truth of the last part of my statement; though
the time was when you did not ask me to bring
vouchers for what I said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For nothing, except your stories of the Crimea
and the Italian war,&#8221; replied the captain of cavalry
with a significant smile. &#8220;I must do you the justice
to say, that I never knew you to tell a falsehood
on any matter connected with your social or
business relations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for so much,&#8221; replied De Banyan.
&#8220;Now that I have made it all right, I suppose you
needn&#8217;t trouble yourself to attend to my affairs
any further.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No trouble at all, I assure you. Under the circumstances,
I shall feel it my duty to deliver you
into the hands of my superiors, and they can do as
they please with you. But I sincerely hope that
you will be able to vindicate your character from
the stain which rests upon it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it needs any vindication.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is some difference of opinion between
us on that point. Where are you going now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Richmond,&#8221; replied De Banyan promptly;
and perhaps he intended to go there with the Army
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
of the Potomac, though its present prospects of
reaching the rebel capital were not very favorable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the way to Richmond. Your stories
don&#8217;t agree very well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was; or rather to Petersburg, and
from there we expected to get a ride up in the
cars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well! I can procure you a pass to
Richmond,&#8221; added the rebel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And an escort to attend us, I suppose,&#8221; replied
De Banyan with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A small one; but here is the house where Captain
Osborn lodges. If he knows your friend here,
and can vouch for his loyalty, all well; if not, we
shall not part two such loving friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Captain Osborn had not risen when the company
of cavalry reached his quarters; but he was called
from his bed, and appeared in front of the house
in the worst possible humor; for, being human, he
did not like to have his slumbers disturbed by unseasonable
calls. As Somers feared Captain Osborn
denied all knowledge of the prisoners, except
so far as related to his interview with them during
the night. He had never seen either of them before;
and he even took the trouble to add that he
didn&#8217;t believe the young fellow was a pilot, which
was gratuitous and uncalled for on his part.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Marvel,&#8221; added the cavalry officer rather
coldly, &#8220;this business is settled very much as I supposed
it would be. I shall have to send you up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
to Richmond, where, if your stories are all true,
I doubt not you will be able to clear yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, captain. You are the same affectionate
fellow you used to be when you were a lieutenant
in the Third Tennessee,&#8221; replied De Banyan
with a sneer; for it was evident that he was not at
all pleased with the result of the affair.
</p>
<p>Four soldiers were detailed from the company
to conduct the prisoners to a certain camp near the
railroad at City Point, and there deliver them over
to the keeping of an officer whose name was mentioned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, captain,&#8221; said De Banyan with
forced gayety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Marvel, and success to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Barney, if there is anything I can
do for you, don&#8217;t fail to call upon me; that is, anything
consistent with the duty of a faithful officer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a remark was entirely uncalled for,&#8221; said
De Banyan with dignity. &#8220;Do you think I would
ask an officer to sacrifice his conscience?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Barney. I meant no offense,&#8221;
added the rebel captain, touched by the proud and
dignified manner of his former friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your words and your conduct are in keeping
with each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Barney, I meant nothing by the
remark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was the more unmanly to make it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am still your friend. In proof of it, permit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
me to do you a favor,&#8221; pleaded the rebel, much
concerned at the wound he had inflicted on the sensitive
nature of his late associate in the Third Tennessee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask no favors,&#8221; answered De Banyan
proudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too hard upon me. Upon my word, I
meant no offense. As a proof of my friendship,
I will take your parole of honor not to escape, and
you shall report at Richmond at your own pleasure.
If you have any interest in this young man,
I will allow him the same favor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After what has happened, I cannot accept a
favor at your hands. I can&#8217;t see how an officer
who doubts my word should be willing to take my
parole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please, Marvel,&#8221; added the captain petulantly.
&#8220;I can do no more for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers was greatly relieved when the rebel officer
rode off, followed by his company. He had
trembled with anxiety, when the parole was offered
to De Banyan, lest he should accept it, and thus
compel him to do the same. Although he could
not see how it was to be brought about, he intended
to escape from the hands of his captors at the first
convenient opportunity, with or without De Banyan,
as the case should demand.
</p>
<p>One of the four troopers detailed to guard the
prisoners was a sergeant, who intimated to them
that they might take up the line of march for the
camp where they were bound. To preclude the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
possibility of an escape, he ordered two of his men
to ride ahead of the captives, while himself and
the other followed in the rear. The little procession
moved off; and there was never a sadder-hearted
young man than Somers, who, were his
true character discovered, was liable to the pains
and penalties of being a spy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sergeant, have you been to breakfast?&#8221; demanded
De Banyan, after they had walked a
couple of miles, and were passing a farm-house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I smell fried bacon, and am willing to pay for
breakfast for the whole party. What do you
say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing in my orders to prevent me
from taking up your offer; and I will do it, if you
will agree not to run away while we are at the
house,&#8221; replied the prudent soldier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How shall we run away, with four men watching
us?&#8221; demanded De Banyan.
</p>
<p>The sergeant seemed to be satisfied with this
argument; and they entered the house, where
breakfast was soon in preparation for them.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE REBEL FARM-HOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p>Somers, besides the chagrin caused by his capture,
was greatly disturbed by the astounding discoveries
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
he had made in regard to Captain de
Banyan. He was extremely anxious to obtain an
opportunity to converse with him in relation to his
disgraceful antecedents; but the presence of the
rebel soldiers prevented him from saying a word.
Yet his looks must have betrayed the distrust he
felt in his companion; for De Banyan seemed to
study his face more than the faces of their captors.
</p>
<p>By this time, the six trusty soldiers who had
been selected to participate in the enterprise must
have given them up, and returned to the camp with
the sad story of their capture. It was mortifying
to Somers to have such a report carried to the general
of the division; for it seemed to be an imputation
upon his skill and tact; but he found some consolation
in believing that he should not have been
taken if it had not been for his unfortunate connection
with Captain de Banyan, who was rash
beyond measure in venturing within the rebel lines,
unless he really meant to return to the Third Tennessee.
</p>
<p>Whatever the captain was, and whatever he intended
to do, Somers could not believe that his late
friend had deliberately betrayed him into the
hands of the enemy. It might be so; or it might be
that to save himself from the consequences of his
alleged desertion, he would claim to have been
always a faithful adherent of the Southern Confederacy.
Somers was perplexed beyond description
by the perils and uncertainties of his situation.
He had, in fact, lost confidence in his companion;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
and the result was, that he resolved to make his
escape, if he could, from the hands of the rebels
without him. Under other circumstances, he would
have deemed it infamous to harbor, for an instant,
the thought of deserting a friend in the hour of
extremity; and nothing but the remembrance of the
Third Tennessee could have induced him to adopt
such a resolution. Having adopted it, he kept his
eyes wide open for any opportunity which would
favor his purpose. His curiosity, excited to the
highest pitch to know what the captain could say
in defense of the heinous charge which had been
fastened upon him by the rebel cavalry officer, and
which he himself had substantiated, rendered the
intention to part company with him very disagreeable;
but the terror of a rebel prison, and perhaps a
worse fate, were potent arguments in its favor.
</p>
<p>In the course of half an hour, the breakfast was
ready, and the party sat down with a hearty relish
to discuss it. The fried bacon and biscuit were
luxuries to Somers, and he partook of them with a
keener satisfaction than he did of the costly viands
of the &#8220;Continental&#8221; and the &#8220;National;&#8221; but,
deeply as he was interested in this pleasant employment,
he hardly ceased for a moment to think of
the grand project of making his escape. For the
time, this had become the great business of existence,
and he banished from his mind all minor
questions.
</p>
<p>Opportunity is seldom wanting to those who are
resolutely determined to do great deeds. Only the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
slow-molded and irresolute want a time and a
place. The breakfast was finished, and the troopers
and their prisoners were on excellent terms with
each other long before the conclusion of the repast.
Eating and drinking promote the social feeling;
and Captain de Banyan was as brilliant as he had
ever been in the camps of the Chickahominy. He
made the rebels laugh, and excited their wonder
by the most improbable stories in which even he
had ever indulged. It would have been impossible
to distinguish between the captives and the captors;
for the latter were extremely considerate, as
they had probably been instructed to be by the captain
of the company.
</p>
<p>When the meal was finished, the troopers rose,
and proposed to resume the journey. De Banyan
paid the bill in gold; for there was still a small
portion of the precious metal in the army.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we are ready,&#8221; said the sergeant; &#8220;and
we will get our horses. It&#8217;s a pity we haven&#8217;t
horses for you; but, when you get tired, we will
give you the use of the saddles for a time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, my friend. That&#8217;s handsome.
You remind me of a Russian major-general, who
insisted that I should ride his animal while he
walked by my side, after I was taken prisoner in the
battle of Austerlitz.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a good fellow,&#8221; replied the sergeant,
who probably did not remember the precise date of
the celebrated battle quoted by the versatile captain.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
&#8220;We shall not be behind him; and, if you
like, you shall have the first ride on my horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; but I couldn&#8217;t think of depriving
you of your horse, even for a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we will settle all that by and by. Come
with me now, if you please,&#8221; said the sergeant, as
he led the way out of the house.
</p>
<p>As very little attention seemed to be paid to
Somers&mdash;for the rebels evidently did not regard
him as either a slippery or a dangerous person&mdash;he
was permitted to bring up the rear. Now, it is
always mortifying to be held in slight esteem,
especially to a sensitive mind like that of our hero;
and he resented the slight by declining to follow the
party. Near the outside door, as they passed out,
he discovered another door, which was ajar, and
which led up-stairs. Without any waste of valuable
time, he slyly stepped through the doorway,
and ascended the stairs. The rebels were so busy
in listening to the great stories of Captain de Banyan,
that they did not immediately discover the
absence of the unpretending young man.
</p>
<p>When our resolute adventurer saw the stairs
through the partially open door, they suggested to
him a method of operations. It is true, he did not
have time to elaborate the plan, and fully determine
what he should do when he went up-stairs;
but the general idea, that he could drop out of a
window and escape in the rear of the house, struck
him forcibly, and he impulsively embraced the opportunity
thus presented. The building was an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
ordinary Virginia farm-house, rudely constructed,
and very imperfectly finished. On ascending the
stairs, Somers reached a large, unfinished apartment,
which was used as a store-room. From it
opened, at each end of the house, a large chamber.
</p>
<p>No place of concealment, which was apparently
suitable for his purpose, presented itself; and, without
loss of time, he mounted a grain chest, and
ascended to the loft over one of the rooms; for the
beams were not floored in the middle of the building.
The aspect of this place was not at all hopeful;
for there were none of those convenient
&#8220;cubby holes,&#8221; which most houses contain, wherein
he could bestow his body with any hope of escaping
even a cursory search for him.
</p>
<p>In the gable end, on one side of the chimney,
which, our readers are aware, is generally built
on the outside of the structure, in Virginia, was a
small window, one-half of which, in the decay of
the glass panes, had been boarded up to exclude
the wind and the rain. The job had evidently been
performed by a bungling hand, and had never been
more than half done. The wood was as rotten as
punk; and without difficulty, and without much
noise, the fugitive succeeded in removing the board
which had covered the lower part of the window.
</p>
<p>By this time the absence of the prisoner had
been discovered, and the rebels were in a state of
high excitement on account of it; but Somers was
pleased to find they had not rightly conjectured
the theory of his escape. He could hear them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
swear, and hear them considering the direction in
which he had gone. Two of them stood under the
window, to which Somers had restored the board
he had removed; and he could distinctly hear all
that they said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he did,&#8221; said one of them. &#8220;He
slipped round the corner of the house when we
came out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he did, where is he? It&#8217;s open ground
round here; and he couldn&#8217;t have gone ten rods
before we missed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain will give it to me,&#8221; replied the
other, whose voice the fugitive recognized to be
that of the sergeant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall find him,&#8221; added the other. &#8220;He
can&#8217;t be twenty rods from here now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not think of the young fellow running
off, but kept both eyes on the other all the time;
for I thought he wasn&#8217;t telling all those stories
for nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he is in the house,&#8221; suggested the other.
</p>
<p>Somers thought that was a very bad suggestion
of the rebel soldier; and, if there had been any
hope of their believing him, he would himself have
informed them that he was not in the house, and
reconciled his conscience as best he could to the
falsehood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t yer find &#8217;em?&#8221; demanded a third person,
which Somers saw, through the aperture he had
left between the board and the window, was the
farmer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t lost but one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t be fur from this yere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he in the house?&#8221; demanded the sergeant
anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I saw them both foller yer out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; added the farmer&#8217;s wife, who had
come out to learn the cause of the excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, we must beat about here, and find
him;&#8221; and the party beneath the window moved
away in the rear of the house.
</p>
<p>Thus far, the project was hopeful; but it was apparent
to Somers that the rebels would not leave
the place without searching the house, after they
had satisfied themselves that the fugitive was not
hidden in any of the out-buildings of the farm. If
they did so, his situation would at once become
hopeless, if he remained where he was. The remembrance
of his former experience in a chimney,
in another part of Virginia, caused him to cast a
wistful eye at the great stone structure which
adorned the end of the building. At that time, he
had occupied his smoky quarters with the knowledge
and consent of the lady of the house. But
now his secret was lodged in his own breast alone;
not even Captain de Banyan knew where he was,
or what he proposed to do.
</p>
<p>When the party beneath the window left the
place, he carefully removed the board, and thrust
out his head to reconnoiter the position. The only
way by which he could enter the chimney, which
his former experience and prejudice assured him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
was the only safe place in the vicinity, was by the
top. To achieve such a result was a difficult piece
of gymnastics, even if it could have been performed
without reference to any spectators; but to accomplish
it without being seen by any of the party below
was as near an impossibility as any impracticable
thing could be.
</p>
<p>The rebels, both civil and military, were now out
of sight; but he doubted not from his eyrie on the
ridge-pole of the house, if he could reach it, they
could all be seen. Somers was as prudent as he
was bold, and he decided not to run any risks until
necessity should absolutely compel such a course.
Quietly ensconcing himself beneath the window,
where he could hear what transpired below, he
waited the issue; but he had studied out the precise
steps which it would be necessary for him to take
in order to reach the roof of the house. He knew
exactly where his right and his left foot were to be
successfully planted to achieve his purpose, when
it could no longer be postponed. But he indulged
a faint hope that the rebels would widen the area
of their search, and finally abandon it when it
should be unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>A long quarter of an hour elapsed&mdash;long enough
to be an hour&#8217;s time as its ordinary flow is measured;
so burdened with intense anxiety was each
second that made up its sum total. The rebels,
assisted by the farmer and his wife, who were now
hardly less zealous than the soldiers, had examined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
every hole and corner in the vicinity of the house,
without finding the escaped prisoner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, he must be in the house,&#8221; said the
sergeant, as the party paused under the window
on their return to the front of the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, ye kin look in the house if yer like;
but I see &#8217;em both go out of the door with yer,&#8221;
persisted the farmer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will search the house,&#8221; added the sergeant
resolutely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer kin, if yer like; but I hope yer won&#8217;t lose
the other feller while ye&#8217;re looking for this one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Gordon to shoot him if he attempted to
get away; and I can trust Gordon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They passed out of hearing, and Somers felt that
his time had come. But, as we have several times
before had occasion to remark, strategy is successful
in one only by the blunders and inertness of the
other; and he cherished with increased enthusiasm
his project of hiding in the chimney. Neither the
farmer nor the soldiers were trained detectives,
and the blunder they made which rendered
Somers&#8217;s strategy more available was in hunting in
crowds instead of singly. They all entered the
house together; and even Gordon, in charge of the
other prisoner, conducted him to the interior, that
he might have the pleasure of seeing the fugitive
unearthed.
</p>
<p>Taking down the board, Somers emerged from
the little window, and, by the steps which he had
before marked out, ascended to the roof; a difficult
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
feat, which would have been impossible to one
whose father was not the master of a vessel, and
who had not explored a ship from the step to the
truck of the mainmast. It was done, safely done,
and without much noise, which would have been
as fatal as a fall. As he sprang from the window
still to a projecting stone in the chimney, he heard
the steps of the whole party on the stairs below.
He was not an instant too soon in the execution
of his project; and, when he reached the ridge-pole
of the house, he paused to recover the breath which
he had lost by excitement and exertion.
</p>
<p>The pursuers occupied some time in examining
the store-room and the adjoining chambers, and he
had a sufficient interval for rest before he renewed
his labors. But in a few moments he heard the
noise caused by the party ascending to the loft over
the room beneath him, and the movement could no
longer be delayed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell yer, sergeant, the feller isn&#8217;t in here!&#8221;
protested the farmer violently, and in a tone loud
enough for Somers to hear him on the roof. &#8220;Be
keerful there, or you&#8217;ll break down the plastering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers could not hear what the sergeant said
in reply; but the farmer was so earnest in his protest
against any further search of his house, that
the fugitive was almost willing to believe that the
protester knew he was in the house, was his friend,
and meant to save him from the hands of his
enemies. But this supposition was too absurd to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
be tolerated, for the farmer could have no possible
interest in his welfare.
</p>
<p>While watching, he had taken off his shoes, and
thrust one into each side-pocket of the old blouse
he wore, partly to save noise, and partly to prevent
his feet from slipping on the smooth stones of the
chimney. Thus prepared, he climbed to the top,
and commenced the descent of the smoky avenue.
He found the opening much smaller than that of
his previous experience in chimneys; and, after he
had descended a few feet, the place became inconveniently
dark. He could no longer hear the steps
or the voices of his pursuers; and he had begun to
congratulate himself on the ultimate success of
his stratagem, when his foot struck upon something
which moved out of his way. It was an animal&mdash;perhaps
a cat. He moved on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit! Lemme alone!&#8221; said a snarling voice
beneath him.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE MAN IN THE CHIMNEY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Lemme alone!&#8221; repeated the voice in the
chimney several times before Somers could make up
his mind as to the precise nature of the adventure
upon which he had stumbled.
</p>
<p>There was another man in the chimney; and this
was the full extent of his knowledge in regard to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
the being who had stepped into his darkened path.
A succession of exciting questions presented themselves
to his mind, all of which were intimately
connected with the individual with whom, for the
moment, his lot seemed to be cast. Was he friend,
or foe? Yankee, rebel, or neutral? What was he
in the chimney for? What business had he there?
</p>
<p>Somers had some knowledge of a useful and
otherwise rightly respectable class of persons,
known as chimney-sweeps, who pursue their dark
trade up and down such places as that in which he
was now burrowing; but the sweeps were a civilized
institution, and he could hardly expect to find
them in this benighted section of the Ancient Dominion.
He did not, therefore, waste a moment in
the consideration of the question, whether the man
beneath him was a chimney-sweep or not; for the
supposition was too improbable even for the pages
of a sensational novel.
</p>
<p>The individual was in the chimney; and there
seemed to be the boundary of knowledge on the
subject. If he was not crazy, he was there for
concealment; and, thus far the two occupants of
the chimney were in sympathy with each other.
Why should the man wish to conceal himself?
Was he a hated Yankee like himself, pursued and
hunted down by the myrmidons of Jeff Davis?
Certainly, if he was a rebel, he had no business in
the chimney. It was no place for rebels; they had
no occasion to be there.
</p>
<p>Of course, then, the man must be a Yankee, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
fellow-sufferer with Somers himself, and therein
entitled to the utmost consideration from him.
But, if a Yankee, what Yankee? The species did
not abound on this side of the river; and he could
not imagine who it was, unless it were one of his
own party. Just then, induced by this train of
reflection, came a tremendous suggestion, which
seemed more probable than anything he had before
thought of. Was it possible that the other denizen
of the sooty flue could be Captain de Banyan?
</p>
<p>His fellow-prisoner had been taken into the
house by his custodian; and, while the guard was
looking the other way, perhaps he had suddenly
popped up the chimney, leaving the rebel soldier
in charge of him to believe that he was in league
with the powers of darkness, and had been spirited
away by some diabolical imp.
</p>
<p>In the range of improbable theories which the
fertile mind of Somers suggested to account for the
phenomenon of the chimney, this seemed more
reasonable than any of the others. The personage
below him very considerately dropped down a step
or two, to enable our theorist to discuss the question
to his own satisfaction; albeit it did not take
him a tithe of the time to do his thinking which it
has taken his biographer to record it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain?&#8221; said he in a gentle whisper, as insinuating
as the breath of a summer evening to a
love-sick girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a captain; I&#8217;m nothing but a private!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
growled the other, who seemed to be in very ill-humor.
</p>
<p>Nothing but a private! It was not the captain
then, after all. He had hoped, and almost believed,
it was. He had told his friend all about his experience
in a chimney; and it seemed to him quite
probable that the valiant hero of Magenta and Solferino
had remembered the affair, and attempted
to try his own luck in a similar manner. It was
not the voice of the captain, nor were there any of
his peculiarities of tone or manner. If the other
character had only said Balaclava, Alma, or
Palestro, it would have been entirely satisfactory
in any tone or in any manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; demanded Somers
in the same low voice, with commendable desire to
obtain further knowledge of the dark subject beneath
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want nothin&#8217; of you; so yer kin let me
alone. If yer don&#8217;t let me alone, I&#8217;ll be dog derned
if I don&#8217;t ketch hold of yer legs, and pull yer down
chimley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Somers in warning tones. &#8220;They
will hear you, if you speak so loud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man was a rebel, or at least a Southerner;
and it passed our hero&#8217;s comprehension to determine
what he was doing in such a place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush yerself!&#8221; snarled the disconcerted rebel.
&#8220;What yer want o&#8217; me? I ain&#8217;t done nothin&#8217; to
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything of you; but, if you don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
keep still, I&#8217;ll drop a stone on your head,&#8221; replied
Somers, irritated by the fellow&#8217;s stupidity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will yer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you keep still. Don&#8217;t you see we are in
the same box? I don&#8217;t want to be caught, any
more than you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who be yer?&#8221; asked the man, a little mollified
by this conciliatory remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind who I am now. The soldiers are
in the house looking for us; and, if you make a
noise, they will hear you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What regiment do yer belong ter?&#8221; said the
lower occupant of the chimney in a whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty-first,&#8221; replied Somers at a venture, willing
to obtain the advantage of the fellow&#8217;s silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did yer run away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Did you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What yer in here fur, if yer didn&#8217;t run away,
then?&#8221; asked the deserter from the rebel army,
which it was now sufficiently evident was his
character.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep still!&#8221; replied Somers, regretting that he
had not given a different answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know yer!&#8221; exclaimed the rebel, making a
movement farther down the chimney, thereby detaching
sundry pieces of stone and mortar, which
thundered down upon the hearth below with a din
louder, as it seemed to Somers in his nervousness,
than all the batteries of the Army of the Potomac.
&#8220;Yer come to ketch me in a trap. Scotch me if I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
don&#8217;t blow yer up so high &#8217;twill take yer six months
ter come down ag&#8217;in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep still!&#8221; pleaded Somers, in despair at the
unreasonableness of the rebel. &#8220;The soldiers are
after me; and, if they catch me, they will catch you.
1 don&#8217;t want to hurt you. If you will only keep
still, I will help you out of the scrape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You go to Babylon! Yer can&#8217;t fool me! What
yer doin&#8217; in the chimley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>If Somers could quietly have put a bullet
through the fellow&#8217;s head, and thus have punished
him for the crime of desertion, he might have promoted
his own cause; but the bullet would not do
its work without powder, and powder was noisy;
and therefore the remedy was as bad as the disorder,
to say nothing of assuming to himself the
duty of a rebel provost-marshal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer can&#8217;t fool me!&#8221; repeated the fellow, after
Somers had tried for a moment the effect of silence
upon him.
</p>
<p>It was unnecessary to fool such an idiot; for Nature
had effectually done the job without human
intervention. It was useless to waste words upon
him; and Somers crept cautiously up out of his
reach, and out of his hearing, unless he yelled out
his insane speeches. Every moment he stopped to
listen for sounds within the house; but he could
hear none, either because the pursuers had abandoned
the search, or because the double thickness
of wood and stone shut out the noise.
</p>
<p>The rebel deserter, for a wonder, kept quiet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
when Somers retreated from him, evidently believing
that actions spoke louder than words. From
his lower position in the flue, he could look up into
the light, and observe the movements of him whom
he regarded as an enemy. He seemed to have discretion
enough to keep still, so long as no direct
attack was made upon him; and to be content to
wait for a direct assault before he attempted to repel
it; which was certainly more than Somers expected
of him, after what had transpired.
</p>
<p>Carefully and noiselessly our fugitive made his
way to the top of the chimney for the purpose of
ascertaining the position of the pursuers, as well
as to remove all ground of controversy with the intractable
deserter. On reaching the top, he heard
the voice of the sergeant at the window, who had
probably just reached this point in his investigations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How came this board knocked off?&#8221; demanded
the sergeant, who had perhaps observed some other
indications of the advance of the fugitive in this
direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind blowed it off t&#8217;other day,&#8221; promptly
replied the farmer. &#8220;Yer don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose the feller
went out that winder, do yer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I think he has been up here somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope yer&#8217;ll find him; but I&#8217;ve showed
yer into every hole and corner in the house; and
I tell yer he&#8217;s five mile from this yere &#8217;fore now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sergeant looked out of the window, looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
up to the top of the chimney, and looked up to the
ridge-pole of the house. He was no sailor himself;
and, if the thought had occurred to him that the
Yankee had passed from this window to the roof
of the house, he would have been willing to take
his Bible oath that not a man in the Southern Confederacy
could have accomplished such an impossible
feat. He could not do it himself, and consequently
he believed that no other man could. After
examining the situation to his entire satisfaction,
he retired from the window, and with a great many
impolite and wicked oaths, aimed at Yankees in
general, and deserters in particular, he descended
from the loft, and abandoned the search.
</p>
<p>Somers was happy, and even forgave the deserter
in the lower part of the chimney for his
stupidity. He waited patiently for the troopers to
depart&mdash;very patiently, now that the burden of the
peril seemed to be over; for he had heard the conclusions
of the sergeant at the window. From his
present perch near the top of the chimney, he could
hear some of the conversation in front of the
house; and he even ventured to take a look at his
enemies below. To his intense satisfaction, he saw
them mount their horses: and he was not much
disturbed by the unamiable reflections which they
cast upon him.
</p>
<p>Captain de Banyan was with them; thus proving
in the most conclusive manner that the gentleman
in the chimney was not this distinguished individual.
Having lost one prisoner, they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
particularly cautious in regard to the disposition
of the other. The captain marched off in gloomy
dignity, with two cavalrymen before and two behind
him. Somers caught a glance at his face as
he turned the corner into the road. It was sad
beyond anything which he had ever observed in
his countenance before, and a momentary twinge
of conscience upbraided him for deserting a comrade
in such an hour; he might have waited till
both of them could escape together. But the captain&#8217;s
record in the Third Tennessee assured him
that he had only done his duty; though he hoped
his brilliant friend would be able, if an opportunity
was ever presented, to remove the stain which now
rested on his name and fame.
</p>
<p>With a feeling of intense relief, however much
he commiserated the misfortunes of his comrade,
Somers saw the little procession move up the road
which led to Richmond and a rebel dungeon. They
disappeared; and while he was considering in what
manner he should make his way down to the creek,
where he hoped to find a boat in which to leave
this treacherous soil, he heard a voice beneath him,
and farther down than the locality of the deserter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer kin come down now, Tom,&#8221; said the
farmer.
</p>
<p>Though the name was his own, the invitation
was evidently not intended for him; and he remained
quietly on his perch, waiting for further
developments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hev they all gone, dad?&#8221; asked the deserter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; all gone. Yer kin come down now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The renegade, then, was the son of the farmer;
which accounted for the unwillingness of the latter
to have the house searched by the soldiers; and,
though Somers had a general contempt for deserters,
he felt his indebtedness to this interesting
family for the service they had unwittingly endeavored
to render him.
</p>
<p>Tom&mdash;Somers wanted to have his name changed
then&mdash;Tom descended from his position in the
chimney. It was an easy matter; for the kitchen
was at the other end of the house, and there had
been no fire on this hearth for many a month.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; said this graceless son of a graceless sire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and wash yer face, Tom. Ye&#8217;re blacker
than Black Jack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad, there&#8217;s another man up the chimley. We
come near havin&#8217; a fight up there. I told him what
I would do; and he got skeered, and went up top.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;yer mean, Tom?&#8221; demanded the
patriarch.
</p>
<p>Tom stated again, more explicitly than before,
the subject matter of his startling communication.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s a Yank, dad; he talks like one,
but says he b&#8217;longs to the Forty-fust Virginny. I
know he&#8217;s a Yank. I kin smell one a mile off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers was flattered; but he was not angry at
the compliment, and calmly waited for an invitation
to join the family below.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the feller that gin the soldiers the slip,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
added the father. &#8220;The sergeant says he&#8217;s a Yank;
but t&#8217;other prisoner says he&#8217;s a James River pilot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he&#8217;s a Yank. He&#8217;d &#8216;a&#8217; killed me if I
hadn&#8217;t skeered him off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he skeered you more&#8217;n you skeered
him,&#8221; added the head of the family, who appeared
not to have a very high opinion of his son&#8217;s
courage. &#8220;We&#8217;ll smoke him out, Tom. Go&#8217;n git
some pitch-wood and sich truck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers had a very strong objection to being
smoked out, and he commenced a forward and
downward movement in the direction of the assailing
party. Fearing that some unworthy advantage
might be taken of his lower extremities before he
could assume an attitude of defense, he drew his
pistol, and placed himself a few feet above the fire-place.
Tom returned with the fuel, and the old
man ordered him to make a fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment, if you please,&#8221; said Somers.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll shoot the first man of you that attempts to
make a fire there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With an exclamation of terror, Tom retreated
from the hearth; and Somers, improving the opportunity,
leaped down from his perch. Stepping out
from the great fire-place, he stood in the presence
of the hopeful son and sire.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>A BROKEN BARGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Somers was entirely satisfied with himself when
he stood in the presence of the farmer and his son;
and, so far as they were concerned, he had no fears
for the future. The redoubtable Tom retired to
one corner of the room, and, full of terror, awaited
the issue. The father was the braver of the two,
and stood in the middle of the floor, confronting
the pestilent Yankee who had thus so unceremoniously
invaded his house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who be you?&#8221; demanded the old man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter who I am,&#8221; replied Somers, with
the pistol still in his hand. &#8220;I propose to spend
the day with you, and will pay for everything I
have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps yer will stay here, and perhaps yer
won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the farmer doggedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no perhaps about it; I intend to stay
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose yer don&#8217;t keer whether I&#8217;m willing or
not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I do care. I had much rather
stay with your consent than without.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, yer won&#8217;t stay with my consent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall stay without it,&#8221; answered Somers,
with a degree of decision which was exceedingly annoying
to his involuntary host.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, yer won&#8217;t,&#8221; growled the farmer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will pay you well for the use of this room,
and for all that I eat and drink,&#8221; said Somers,
wishing to be fully understood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer can&#8217;t stay here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, yer can&#8217;t,&#8221; added Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have made you a fair offer, and am willing
to do what is right; and, as I said before, I intend
to stay here till to-night, whether you are willing
or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer kin put up your pistol; I ain&#8217;t afeerd on
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no desire to use the pistol to your injury,
and shall not do so unless in self-defense.
You know that I am a fugitive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A nigger, by gracious!&#8221; exclaimed the farmer,
whose vocabulary was very limited, and who had
no idea that the word &#8220;fugitive&#8221; could mean anything
but a runaway negro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that the soldiers are after me, and it
will not be safe for me to leave this house before
dark. I&#8217;m not a nigger; and it makes no difference
to you what I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a dirty Yankee; and I&#8217;d rather hev a
hundred niggers in my house than one Yankee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a matter of taste. If you are fond of
negroes, I don&#8217;t interfere with you for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shet up!&#8221; snarled the farmer, highly displeased
with the answer of the fugitive. &#8220;I won&#8217;t hev a
Yankee in my house a single hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; we won&#8217;t argue the matter. You
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
can do anything you please about it,&#8221; replied
Somers with perfect indifference as he seated himself
in a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then yer kin leave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not leave; on the contrary, I shall remain
here till night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll see about that. I&#8217;ll jest go down
and call up two or three of them soldiers, and let
&#8217;em know you&#8217;re a Yankee. I calkilate they&#8217;ll tote
you out of this rather sudden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; replied Somers coolly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon ye&#8217;ll tell another story by the time
they git here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon your son Tom will too,&#8221; added the unwelcome
guest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, dad; that won&#8217;t work, nohow,&#8221; interposed
the hopeful son. &#8220;They&#8217;ll ketch me if yer
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly so,&#8221; added Somers, who, of course,
had depended upon the situation of the rebel deserter
for his own safety.
</p>
<p>The farmer looked at his intractable guest, and
then upon his dutiful son; and the idea tardily
passed through his dull brain that the soldiers
would be just as dangerous to the welfare of the
son as to the visitor. Probably he had intended,
when the military force came, to send Tom up the
chimney, as he had done a dozen times before; but
the secret was no longer in the keeping of the
family alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you understand the case perfectly,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
Somers, as he contemplated with intense satisfaction
the blank dismay of both father and son. &#8220;If
you had the wisdom of Solomon, you couldn&#8217;t comprehend
it any better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon ye&#8217;re about right, stranger,&#8221; replied
the farmer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see now it is for your interest as well
as mine that we make friends. Tom&#8217;s safety and
mine are both the same thing. The best you can do
is to take good care of me to-day, and at night help
me to make my way over to the other side of the
river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then yer be a Yank?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say so. Tom can go with me if he
likes. He will be safer there than here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he is a deserter from the rebel army, he will
be caught sooner or later, and be shot. He will
be safe on the other side of the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go over to the Yanks! He hates &#8217;em wurs&#8217;n
pizin. Don&#8217;t yer, Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet yer life I do, dad,&#8221; replied the hopeful
son. &#8220;I won&#8217;t go over thar, nohow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as he pleases about that. I only wanted
to do him a friendly act.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, stranger, I don&#8217;t mind keepin&#8217; yer to-day;
but Tom can&#8217;t go with yer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; then I will stay in this room; and,
if the soldiers come, I can go up the chimney with
Tom,&#8221; replied Somers. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired and sleepy.
Didn&#8217;t sleep a wink last night. I will take a nap
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
on the floor. You will wake me, Tom, if there&#8217;s
any danger; won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll wake yer,&#8221; replied the deserter with a
broad grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see that you don&#8217;t git caught; kase, if
yer do, of course, Tom&#8217;ll git caught too,&#8221; added
the farmer.
</p>
<p>There was something in his manner which
Somers did not like. Though he was a man of
dull mind, there was a kind of low cunning visible
in his look and manner which warned Somers to be
cautious. He stretched himself on the floor; and
the farmer and his son left the room, closing the
door behind them.
</p>
<p>Our scout was, as he had before declared, both
tired and sleepy; but rest and sleep were luxuries
in which he could not permit himself to indulge
in the midst of so much peril and so many enemies.
As soon as the door closed behind the sire and the
son, he rose from his reclining posture, and hastened
to reconnoiter the position. The enemy&mdash;for
such he was fully assured his host was&mdash;passed
through the entry and out the door at the back of
the house, as Somers discovered from the noise of
their retreating footsteps.
</p>
<p>There was a window in the rear of the room,
which commanded a full view of them as they
paused near the door to consider the situation.
Somers raised the sash a little, so that he could
hear what they said, not doubting that his own case
would be the subject of the conversation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it, dad,&#8221; protested Tom in answer
to some proposition which the farmer had
made before the listener came within hearing distance
of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t yer be skeert, Tom. The feller&#8217;s gone
ter sleep in there, and the soldiers kin hurry him
off afore he wakes up. Don&#8217;t yer see, Tom? I
reckon the Yank&#8217;s an officer, and they&#8217;ll give me
suthin handsome fur ketchin him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but, dad, they&#8217;ll get suthin handsome fur
ketchin me too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You kin hide, as yer allers does when they
comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Yank will blow on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What if he does?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em I&#8217;m up chimley, and then they&#8217;ll
look fur me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, ye&#8217;re a bigger fool&#8217;n yer father!&#8221; said
the farmer petulantly. &#8220;Can&#8217;t yer hide in t&#8217;other
place down suller?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks kinder skeery, dad,&#8221; replied the doubtful
son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer used ter hide down suller more&#8217;n yer did
up chimley. But don&#8217;t yer see, Tom, arter I&#8217;ve
called in the soldiers, and give up the Yank, they&#8217;ll
think I&#8217;m a patriot, and won&#8217;t b&#8217;leeve nothin&#8217; a
dirty Yank can say agin&#8217; me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dad, I hate the Yank as bad as you do;
but yer must be keerful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now go and see that the feller don&#8217;t wake up
and run off, and I&#8217;ll go down arter a sergeant and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
half a dozen men. When yer hear us comin&#8217;, just
step down suller&#8217;n crawl inter the drean. Git the
feller&#8217;s pistol out of his pocket, if yer kin, while
he&#8217;s asleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a precious old scoundrel that man is!&#8221;
thought Somers, as he retreated from the window,
and threw himself on the floor where the farmer
had left him.
</p>
<p>He almost regretted that he had not used his
pistol on the treacherous old villain, who had made
a fair bargain with him, and agreed to the terms
of the contract. The wretch had actually gone
after the soldiers to entrap him, and Tom was to
remain and keep watch of him in the meantime.
Taking the revolver from his pocket, he thrust it
under his blouse; still keeping his hand upon it,
so as to make sure that the deserter did not carry
out his part of the programme. Thus prepared for
the conflict which might ensue, or for any other
event, he closed his eyes, and pretended to be
asleep.
</p>
<p>Presently the door softly opened, and Tom crept
into the room. He had taken off his shoes, that his
step on the uncarpeted floor might not disturb his
prey, and stole towards him. After approaching
as near to the prostrate form as he dared, he bent
over him to determine in which pocket the pistol
had been placed. Somers was tempted to grapple
him by the throat, as he listened to the young villain&#8217;s
subdued breathing; but he feared that he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
would scream if he did so, and it was necessary to
achieve his conquest in a more gentle manner.
</p>
<p>He moved his body a little, as if his slumbers
were disturbed by unpleasant dreams; and added
a noise like a snore to complete the delusion. Tom
retired for a moment till his victim should again
be composed; but Somers, instead of subsiding into
the slumber of a sleepy and tired man, gradually
opened his eyes and waked up. Slowly rising into
a sitting posture, he looked around him; and apparently,
as if entirely by accident, he discerned
Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t yer sleep?&#8221; asked Tom, with extraordinary
good nature for a person of his saturnine disposition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been asleep these two hours, I believe,&#8221;
gaped Somers. &#8220;What time is it, Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t eight o&#8217;clock yet. Yer hain&#8217;t been
asleep more&#8217;n fifteen minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more&#8217;n that. Better lay down, and finish
yer nap; kase I s&#8217;pose yer won&#8217;t git much sleep to-night,
if ye&#8217;re gwine over the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel better than I did, at any rate. I think
I&#8217;ll get up. It&#8217;s tremendous hot here. Don&#8217;t you
ever open your windows?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we do. I was just thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And it was quite probable he was thinking of
it; for he certainly wanted the earliest information
of the approach of the soldiers. He opened the
window in the front of the house, and Somers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
opened that in the rear. The latter then went to
the door, and took a careful survey of the entry,
in order to determine the way which the deserter
must take to reach the cellar, where he was to conceal
himself when the soldiers came. The prudent
son of the master of the house had opened the door
leading to the cellar, from which he was to enter
his subterranean retreat.
</p>
<p>For more than an hour, Tom nervously watched
the wakeful Yankee, and several times suggested
to him that he could sleep just as well as not,
promising to wake him up if there was any danger;
but Somers was most provokingly lively for a man
who had been up all the preceding night, and
resolutely refused to take a hint or to adopt a suggestion.
Both of them were fearfully anxious for
the result that was pending, and each had his plan
for overreaching the other. It was a long hour;
but at last Tom broke the spell which seemed to
rest on both of them by declaring that he was
&#8220;clean choked up,&#8221; and must go and get a drink
of water. At the same moment, Somers heard the
tramp of the soldiers in the road as they approached
the house, and understood why his companion
had suddenly become so thirsty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Somers, placing himself between the
deserter and the door, with the revolver in his
hand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be left alone. Somebody
is coming to the house&mdash;half a dozen men. They
are soldiers!&#8221; he exclaimed, glancing out at the
window.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Run right up chimley thar, and you&#8217;ll be as
safe as if you was t&#8217;other side of the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;ll catch you too! Come, Tom, up
chimney with you, and I&#8217;ll follow. If any one attempts
to follow us, I&#8217;ll shoot him with my pistol.
Be in a hurry, Tom! We have no time to spare,&#8221;
urged Somers, driving the coward before him towards
the fire-place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You go up fust,&#8221; pleaded Tom, in mortal
terror of the revolver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with you, or I&#8217;ll blow your brains out!&#8221;
added Somers in a low, fierce tone, which frightened
his companion half out of his wits.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fire, and I will,&#8221; replied the wretch, as
he stepped into the fire-place, and commenced the
ascent of the chimney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with you!&#8221; repeated Somers. &#8220;Now, if
you attempt to come down, I&#8217;ll shoot you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voice of the farmer, leading the soldiers to
their prey, was now heard close to the house; and
Somers deemed it prudent no longer to remain in
the room. Darting out into the entry, he made his
way to the cellar, closing the door behind him just
as the rebels were about to enter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; demanded the sergeant, who belonged
to the battery at the works near the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this room,&#8221; replied the farmer, putting his
hand on the door of the apartment where he had
seen the victim lie down to sleep an hour before.
&#8220;But yer must be keerful with him. He had a
pistol, and mebbe he mought shoot some on us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t afraid of all the Yankees this side
of the north pole,&#8221; added the sergeant, as he
pushed the door open and entered the room, followed
by his squad of soldiers. &#8220;Where is he?
There aren&#8217;t no Yankee here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he was here an hour ago,&#8221; said the
farmer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, old man, if you&#8217;ve been makin&#8217; a fool
of us this hot day, I&#8217;ll spit you on my bayonet.
We heard that a deserter and a Yankee had been
taken, and that the cavalry lost one of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the Yankee. They lost him, and I
found him ag&#8217;in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He aren&#8217;t far from here,&#8221; said the farmer,
walking up to the fire-place, and pointing up the
chimney, where he had no doubt the victim had retired
when he heard the soldiers approaching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where the feller hid when the troopers
was lookin&#8217; fur him; and yer kin be sure he&#8217;s up
there now. But yer must be keerful; fur he&#8217;s got a
pistol, and is a mighty savage fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon bring him down,&#8221; added the sergeant
as he stepped into the fire-place, and looked
up the chimney. &#8220;I see him; but he&#8217;s half way up
to the top. I reckon we can smoke him out best.
Come, old man, take some of this pitch-wood, that
will make a big smoke, and kindle a fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon have him,&#8221; said the farmer as he
obeyed the order.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Yank!&#8221; shouted the sergeant up the
chimney; &#8220;if you don&#8217;t want to be smoked out,
come down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No answer came to this polite suggestion; and
then one of the soldiers proposed to fire his musket
up the chimney; which so terrified the occupant
thereof, that he begged for mercy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot, and I&#8217;ll come down!&#8221; groaned
the wretch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cowardly Yank! He&#8217;s like all the rest
of them. Come down quick, then!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The farmer, who had stepped out for more
wood, returned; and at the same moment, Tom the
deserter, begrimed with soot, dropped down on
the hearth, and stepped out into the room.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>SOMERS IS COMPELLED TO BACK OUT</h3>
</div>

<p>Very likely the Virginia farmer had some idea
of retributive justice when he saw his hopeful son
step out of the fire-place into the very jaws of ruin.
To say that he was astonished would be expressing
his state of mind too tamely; for he was overwhelmed
with confusion, fear and mortification.
He had expected to find the Yankee asleep on the
floor; but, as he was not there, it was sufficiently
evident to him that he had again resorted to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
chimney for concealment. It had been distinctly
arranged beforehand, that Tom, his son, should
conceal himself in the cellar; and, of course, he
did not expect to find him in the chimney.
</p>
<p>In short, all his expectations had been defeated,
and he himself had opened the trap for his son to
enter. He probably knew how strict was the discipline
of the rebel army in respect to deserters. He
had frequently heard of executions of persons of
this class; and he could hardly expect his son to
escape the penalty of his misconduct. He had
broken his bargain with the fugitive; and, in attempting
to surrender him to his implacable
enemies, he had deprived his heir of liberty, if not
of life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your Yankee, is it?&#8221; demanded the
sergeant, as he gazed at the remnants of the rebel
uniform which Tom still wore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; this ain&#8217;t the Yankee!&#8221; stammered
the farmer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t tell us who he is; for we
know. I was told to keep a sharp lookout for one
Tom Rigney, a deserter; and I reckon this is the
chap. You are my prisoner, my fine lad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now, dad!&mdash;d&#8217;ye see what ye&#8217;ve done?&#8221;
snarled poor Tom Rigney, as he glanced reproachfully
at the patriarch, who had unwittingly sprung
the trap upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it, Tom,&#8221; replied Farmer Rigney,
appalled at the calamity which had overtaken his
house.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you bring me in here to capture this
boy?&#8221; asked the sergeant, who appeared to be bewildered
by the unnatural act of the father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought yer here to take the Yank, who was
as sassy as a four-year-old colt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He promised the Yankee he&#8217;d take keer on him
till night,&#8221; added the vengeful Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was only to keep him here till I could
fotch somebody to take keer on him,&#8221; pleaded the
farmer. &#8220;The Yank must be up chimley now,&#8221;
he continued, reminded that his own reputation
for loyalty to the great and general Southern Confederacy
was now doubly compromised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t up there, dad, nohow,&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; demanded the sergeant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it was too dark, up chimley, to see
anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you seen him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I have. He woked up, and druv me
up chimley right smart, with the pistol in his hand;
reckon, if I hadn&#8217;t gone, I&#8217;d been a dead man; I&#8217;ll
be dog scotched if I shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say he drove you up the chimney?&#8221; demanded
the sergeant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he go, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do know! If you don&#8217;t tell, you&#8217;ll get
a bayonet through your vitals,&#8221; said the soldier
sternly, as he demonstrated with the ugly weapon
he had fixed on his gun before he began to examine
the chimney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno,&#8221; replied the deserter sulkily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer, or take the consequences!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno. Jes as lief be stuck with a bagonet as
shot by a file of soldiers,&#8221; answered Tom, to whom
the future looked even more dark than the present.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell, Tom,&#8221; pleaded his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno, dad; I was up chimley when he left.
Dunno no more&#8217;n the dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Perhaps the sergeant concluded that Tom&#8217;s position
was a reasonable one, and that it would not
have been possible for him to see, from his dark
retreat, where the Yankee had gone. At any rate,
he was saved from further persecution; and two of
the men were ordered to conduct him to the camp,
while the remainder stayed to continue the search
for the fugitive. Farmer Rigney protested and
pleaded, and even offered to warm the palms of
the soldier&#8217;s hands with certain pieces of gold
which he had in the house; but, unfortunately for
the patriotic farmer, the sergeant was above a
bribe, and Tom was hurried off to his doom.
</p>
<p>A careful search of the house and premises was
now instituted; and this time the farmer was a
zealous co-operator with the soldiers; for it was
necessary for him to establish his own loyalty before
he could do anything to save his son from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
deserter&#8217;s fate. The party proceeded up-stairs
first, and carefully examined every closet, and
every nook and corner which could by any possibility
contain the form of a man. As Somers was
not up-stairs, of course they did not find him; and
we will not weary our readers by following them
in their fruitless search.
</p>
<p>Somers went down into the cellar, closing the
door after him; and, as he may be lonesome in his
gloomy retreat, we will join him there, though
it was rather a tight place for more than one person.
The cellar was dark when the fugitive made
his advent within its somber shades; and, as he was
an utter stranger in the place, he was not a little
bewildered by the awkwardness of the situation.
He was in darkness, and wished for light; at
least, for enough to enable him to find the hiding-place
of which he had heard the farmer speak.
</p>
<p>This snug retreat, where the deserter had balked
his pursuers, was undoubtedly the cellar drain;
though, to Somers, it appeared to be a Virginia
notion to have it long enough to admit the form
of a man. Tom Rigney was a larger person than
himself; and the case was hopeful enough, if he
could only find the opening. The cellar contained
various boxes, barrels, firkins and other articles,
the mass of which were piled up in one corner.
</p>
<p>Somers followed the wall entirely around, from
the pile in the corner, till he returned to it, without
finding what he desired. It was sufficiently evident,
therefore, that the entrance to the drain was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
under the boxes and barrels, which had probably
been placed over it to ward off the over-inquisitive
gaze of any visitors who might explore the cellar.
Our enterprising hero immediately commenced the
work of burrowing beneath the rubbish, and soon
had the happiness of discovering the identical road
by which the original occupant of the place had
entered. Before the opening, he found sufficient
space to enable him to readjust the boxes and
barrels, so as to hide his den from the observation
of any who might be disposed to follow him in his
subterranean explorations.
</p>
<p>The drain was certainly small enough, even for
the genteel form of Captain Thomas Somers;
though, as his mustache was quite diminutive in
its proportions, he was able to worry himself along
several feet into the gloomy hole. It was a miserable
place in which to spend the day; but, miserable
as it was, he hoped that he should be permitted
to remain there. He was fully conscious
of the perils of his situation. He knew that Tom,
in the chimney, must be captured; and it was not
probable that the farmer would let the soldiers depart
without examining the house. His retreat
was known to him, and there was not one chance
in a hundred for the hole to be passed by without
an examination.
</p>
<p>It would be fatal to remain where he was; and,
after resting himself from the fatigue which the
exertion of moving in his narrow den induced, he
again pushed forward, cheered by the conclusion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
that a drain would be a useless institution without
an opening at each end. Indeed, there was a glimmer
of light at some distance before him; and he
indulged the hope that he might work his way out
to the blue sky.
</p>
<p>He had scarcely resumed his progressive movement,
which had to be accomplished very much
after the fashion of a serpent&mdash;for the aperture
was too narrow for the regular exercise of his legs
and arms&mdash;he had scarcely begun to move before
voices in the cellar announced the approach of the
pursuers. A cold sweat seemed to deluge his
frame; for the sounds were like the knell of doom
to him. With desperate energy he continued his
serpent march; but it was only to butt his head
against the stones of the drain, where its size was
reduced to less than half its proportions near the
cellar.
</p>
<p>His farther advance was hopelessly checked; and
there was nothing more to be done but to wait patiently
the result of the exciting event. He was
satisfied that his feet were not within eight or ten
feet of the cellar; for, being a progressive young
man, he had entered the hole head first. It was
possible, but not probable, that he might escape
detection, even if the opening was examined; and,
with what self-possession he could muster for the
occasion, he lay, like the slimy worms beneath him,
till ruin or safety should come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he isn&#8217;t down here,&#8221; said the sergeant,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
after the party had examined the cellar, and even
pulled over some of the boxes and barrels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you for a stupid fellow as you are!&#8221;
thought Somers; for he was prudent enough not
audibly to invoke benedictions, even upon the heads
of his enemies; but the words of the sergeant
afforded him a degree of relief, which no one, who
has not burrowed in a drain in the rebel country,
can understand or appreciate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s a place down in that corner
that&#8217;s big enough to hold a man; fur my son Tom&#8217;s
been in there,&#8221; added the farmer.
</p>
<p>These words gave Somers another cold sweat;
and perhaps he thought it was a mistake that he
had not put a bullet through the patriarch&#8217;s head
when he had been tempted to do so in the room
above. He was a double traitor; but I think the
conscience of our hero was more at rest as it was
than it would have been if he had shot down an unarmed
man, even to save himself from prospective
capture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the place?&#8221; demanded the sergeant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In yonder, under them barrels and boxes. Jest
fotch the trumpery out, and you&#8217;ll see the hole,&#8221;
replied Rigney.
</p>
<p>Somers heard the rumble of the barrels, as they
were rolled out of the way, with very much the
same feelings that a conscious man in a trance
would listen to the rumbling of the wheels of the
hearse which was bearing him to the church-yard,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
only that he was to come forth from a hopeless
grave to the more gloomy light of a rebel dungeon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see anything in that hole,&#8221; said the
sergeant. &#8220;No man could get into such a place as
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed are your eyes; for they see not!&#8221;
thought Somers. &#8220;May your blindness be equal to
that of the scribes and Pharisees!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But my son Tom has been in there. I reckon
a Yankee could crawl inter as small a hole as anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sergeant thought this was funny; and he
honored the remark with a hearty laugh, in which
Somers was disposed to join, though he regretted
for the first time in his life that he was unable to
&#8220;crawl out at the little end of the horn.&#8221; He was
encouraged by the skepticism of the soldier, and
was satisfied, that, if he attempted to demonstrate
the proposition experimentally, he would be fully
convinced of its difficulty, if not of its impossibility.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and bring another lamp and a pole,&#8221; said
the sergeant.
</p>
<p>One of the party went up the stairs, and Somers
gave himself up for lost. The extra lamp would
certainly expose him, to say nothing of the pole;
and it seemed to be folly to remain there, and be
punched with a stick, like a woodchuck in his hole.
Besides, there is something in tumbling down gracefully,
when one must inevitably tumble; and he
was disposed to surrender gracefully, as the coon
did when he learned that Colonel Crockett was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
about to fire and bring him down. There was no
hope; and it is bad generalship, as well as inhuman
and useless, to fight a battle which is lost before
the first shot is fired.
</p>
<p>We have before intimated that Captain Somers,
besides being a brave and enterprising young man,
was a philosopher. He had that happy self-possession
which enables one to bear the ills of life, as
well as the courage and address to triumph over
them. He had done everything which ingenuity,
skill, and impudence could accomplish to save himself
from the hands of the rebel soldiers; from a
rebel prison, if not from a rebel halter. He had
failed; and, though it gave him a bitter pang to
yield his last hope, he believed that nothing better
could be done than to surrender with good grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, sergeant?&#8221; shouted he, when he
had fully resolved upon his next step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo!&#8221; replied the sergeant, laughing heartily
at the hail from the bowels of the earth. &#8220;How
are you, Yank?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a tight place, sergeant; and I&#8217;ve concluded
to back out,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! That&#8217;s what all the Yankees will have
to do before they grow much older. Back out,
Yank!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers commenced the operation, which was an
exceedingly unpleasant necessity to a person of his
progressive temperament. It was a slow maneuver;
but the sergeant waited patiently till it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
accomplished, by which time the extra lamp and
the pole had reported for duty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, Yank?&#8221; said the sergeant, laughing
immoderately at the misfortune of his victim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the smallest hole I ever attempted to
crawl through,&#8221; replied Somers, puffing and blowing
from the violence of his exertions in releasing
himself from his narrow prison-house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How came you in such a place?&#8221; asked the sergeant
as they walked up the stairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my friend, the farmer here, suggested
the idea to me. He said his son had crawled in
there a great many times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; exclaimed Rigney. &#8220;I never said a word
about the drean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be looked after,&#8221; added the sergeant,
with a menacing look at the discomfited farmer.
&#8220;You have concealed a deserter in your house for
weeks; and now we find that you hide Yankees
too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hide him!&#8221; protested Rigney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you agree to keep me here till night?&#8221;
asked Somers, who despised him beyond expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did, it was only to have the soldiers ketch
yer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sergeant declared that Rigney was a traitor,
and that he must go along with him; but Somers,
with more magnanimity than many men would
have exercised towards such a faithless wretch,
told the whole story exactly as it was, thus relieving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
him of a portion of his infidelity to the Southern
Confederacy; and the sergeant was graciously
pleased to let him remain at home, while his victim
was marched off to the rebel camp.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT IN PETERSBURG</h3>
</div>

<p>The sergeant who had captured our hero
seemed to be a very clever fellow, and appreciated
the sterling merits of his captive. While he was
rigidly devoted to the discharge of his duty, he
treated his prisoner with all the consideration
which one human being has the right to expect of
another, whatever the circumstances under which
they meet.
</p>
<p>Somers was disgusted with the result of the adventure,
even while he had no reason to blame himself
for any want of care or skill in conducting his
affairs under the trying circumstances. He was
only a few hours behind his late companion, Captain
de Banyan; whom he had now a reasonable
expectation of meeting again before the close of the
day.
</p>
<p>If Somers was disgusted with the issue of the
adventure, he did not yet despair of effecting his
escape. This was all he had to live for at present;
and he was determined not to lose sight of this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
great object of existence. Libby Prison was a
flourishing institution, even at the time of which
we write; and he was determined not to be sent
there, if human energy and perseverance could save
him from such a fate. It was easier to avoid such
a trap than it would be to get out of it after he had
fallen into it. As he walked along with the talkative
sergeant, he kept his eyes open, ready to avail
himself of any opportunity which might afford him
a reasonable prospect of shaking off his disagreeable
companion.
</p>
<p>His captor asked him a great many questions in
regard to himself, and to the Army of the Potomac
on the other side of the river, which Somers answered
with skill and discretion; though we suppose
that even a rigid moralist would have excused
some slight variations from the strict letter of the
truth which crept into his replies. He was an
officer in the Yankee army; but he dared not acknowledge
his rank, lest he should be accused of
being a spy. If he was a captain, he ought to have
worn the uniform of his rank in order to have it
recognized. As he was a private, his chance of
spending the summer on Belle Isle was better
than that for Libby. But, as Somers was fully resolved
not to go to Richmond in advance of the
noble army whose fortunes and misfortunes he had
shared, he did not deem it necessary to consider
what quarters he should occupy.
</p>
<p>The sergeant was a faithful soldier. Somers
found no opportunity to slip away from his guard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
on the way to the camp. He was duly delivered to
the officer of the day, and his intimacy with his
good-natured captor was at an end. The officer
who was responsible for him made some inquiries
in regard to the prisoner, and learned that he had
escaped from the troopers in the morning. When
he understood the case, as it was only eight miles
to the railroad station, where the other prisoner
was probably waiting a conveyance in the camp,
he decided to send Somers forward at once, fearful
that he might again take leave of his captors.
From what he had heard from Captain Osborn and
the cavalry soldiers in charge of him, he concluded
that the young man was a person of more consequence
than he appeared to be&mdash;that he was either
high in rank, or guilty of enormous military misdemeanors.
</p>
<p>A two-horse wagon used for general business
about the camp was brought up, and Somers was
sent forward in charge of two soldiers, who were
especially ordered to shoot him if he attempted to
escape; which they would probably have done of
their own free will and accord, without any orders.
The captive looked in vain for an opportunity to
elude the vigilance of the guard; they hardly took
their eyes off him during the ride. Possibly they
thought the young fellow was President Lincoln
in disguise, and that the salvation of the Southern
Confederacy depended upon his safe delivery into
the hands of the provost-marshal at Richmond.
</p>
<p>The roads were very muddy from the recent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
rains, and it required two hours to accomplish the
distance to the railroad station. On their arrival,
Somers was handed over to another officer in
charge of the camp at the station. Captain de
Banyan had already been sent forward to Petersburg,
and another train would not depart till evening.
Somers was carefully guarded during the
remainder of the day, and an attempt to get away
would have been equivalent to committing suicide.
At dark he was put into a baggage-car, with two
soldiers to guard him; and in a short time reached
the city of Petersburg. With several other unfortunate
Union soldiers, he was placed in a small
room in the station-house, to remain until a train
should start for Richmond. Of course, they were
carefully guarded; and Somers began to fear that
he should, after all, be compelled to visit the rebel
capital without the army.
</p>
<p>The room was on the second floor, with two windows
opening into the street; but the prisoners
were charged, on penalty of being shot, not to look
out at them. There was not the ghost of a chance
to operate under such unfavorable circumstances;
and Somers gave up all thoughts of doing anything
that night. Stretching himself on the floor, he
tried to sleep; but his spirit was too great to permit
him calmly to view the prospect of a rebel
prison. As he lay on the floor, he ransacked his
brain for some expedient which would save him
from the horrors of Libby or Belle Isle.
</p>
<p>The best scheme that suggested itself was to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
leap from the cars on the way to Richmond. It
involved the liability to a broken neck or a broken
limb; but he determined to watch for an opportunity
to execute this reckless purpose. His companions
in bondage were worn out with long
marches, and all of them slept on the floor around
him in a few moments after they entered the room.
They had asked him some questions; but he kept
his own counsel, and endeavored to cheer their desponding
spirits with the hope of being soon
exchanged.
</p>
<p>At last Somers went to sleep himself, after he
had heard a church clock in the city strike eleven.
He had slept none on the preceding night, and his
slumbers were as sound as if he had been in his
attic-chamber in the cottage at Pinchbrook. Even
the opening of the door, and the entrance of three
men with a lantern, did not disturb him. One of
the party was an officer. He wore a military cloak
over the gray uniform of the Confederate army.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is the man?&#8221; demanded he in sharp
tones of the two soldiers who accompanied him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know which he is now,&#8221; replied the
corporal of the guard. &#8220;What&#8217;s his name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Leathers,&#8221; answered the officer.
</p>
<p>The corporal then passed round among the
sleeping prisoners, and roughly kicked those who
were asleep, including Somers, who sprang to his
feet, and was rather disposed to make a &#8220;row&#8221; on
account of this rude treatment, before he remembered
where he was.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now they are all awake,&#8221; said the corporal
when he had been the rounds. &#8220;Is there any such
man as Tom Leathers here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Leathers,&#8221; repeated the officer in a loud
tone.
</p>
<p>No one answered to the name; but, in a moment,
Somers happened to think that this was the appellative
which he had assumed when he was a
pilot down on the creek by the James River. He
was evidently the person intended; but he was in
doubt whether to answer the summons. The antecedents
of the young pilot of the James were not
such as to entitle him to much consideration at
the hands of the rebels; and he was disposed to
deny his identity. While he was debating the
question in his own mind, the corporal repeated
the name.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no such man here,&#8221; he added, turning
to the officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be here. He came up in the night
train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t answer to his name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your lantern, and let me look these
prisoners in the face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The corporal passed from one to another of the
captives till he came to Somers; thrusting the
lantern into the face of each, so that the officer
could scan his features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; he asked, as the corporal
placed the lantern before Somers.
</p>
<p>Not having made up his mind as to the effect of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
acknowledging his identity with the pilot, he made
no reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man,&#8221; said the officer decidedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your name Tom Leathers?&#8221; added the corporal,
as he made a demonstration with his bayonet
at the prisoner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put down your musket, corporal; you needn&#8217;t
be a brute to your prisoners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wanted to make him answer the question.
If you give me leave, I&#8217;ll find a tongue for
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the man I want; bring him out,&#8221; replied
the officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring him out? I beg your pardon, sir; but
I don&#8217;t know who you are. I can&#8217;t give up a
prisoner without orders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officer, who seemed to be suffering with a
bad cold, and wore the collar of his cloak turned
up so as to conceal the greater part of his face,
opened the lower part of his garment, so that the
corporal could see his uniform. At the same time
he took from his pocket a paper, which he opened,
and handed to the guard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the latter, when he had
read the document. &#8220;Of course, you will leave
this with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Now bring out the man; and lose
no time, for I am in a hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers was conducted from the room to the car-house
below, where the officer asked for a soldier
to guard the prisoner to the office of the provost-marshal,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
who was waiting for him. The corporal
furnished the man; and the captive walked off
between his two companions, bewildered by the
sudden change which had taken place in the course
of events. He could not imagine why he had been
singled out from the rest of the prisoners in the
station-house, unless some specific and more definite
charge than being in arms against the great
Southern Confederacy had been laid at his door.
The most unpleasant thought that came to his
mind was that Captain de Banyan had betrayed
the object of his mission to the south side of the
river. There was good evidence that his fellow-officer
had come over as a spy; and the hope of
saving his own life might have induced him to
sacrifice even one who had been his best friend.
</p>
<p>It was not pleasant to think of Captain de Banyan
as capable of doing so mean an act; for he had
been regarded in the regiment as the soul of honor,&mdash;of
worldly honor, which scorns to do a vile thing
if public opinion has condemned it. But the astounding
information which he had obtained
among the rebels concerning his friend&#8217;s antecedents
had destroyed his confidence in him, and he
was prepared for anything from him. In this
light, his situation was almost hopeless; for the
evidence would certainly condemn him before any
court-martial in the Confederacy, and the chances
of escape were lessened by his separation from his
unfortunate companions in arms. He had probably
been taken away from them to prevent even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
the possibility of exercising his talent in getting
away, as he had done after his capture.
</p>
<p>They walked in silence along the gloomy and
deserted streets; and Somers felt just as if he were
marching to his execution. He knew that the
rebel officers had a summary way of dealing with
cases like his own; and he was prepared to be condemned,
even before another sun rose to gladden
him with his cheerful light. He thought of his
mother, of his father, of the other members of the
family, and of the blow it would be to them to
learn that he had been hanged as a spy. He
thought of Pinchbrook, of the happy days he had
spent there, and of those who had been his true
friends. He thought of Lilian Ashford, the beautiful
one, in the remembrance of whose sweet smile
he had reveled every day since they parted, and
which he had hoped to enjoy again when war
should no more desolate the land, and he should
be proudly enrolled with the heroes who had saved
the nation from ruin.
</p>
<p>All these pleasant memories, all these bright
hopes, all these loving forms, though present in
his heart, seemed dim and distant to him. He had
nothing to hope for in the future on this side of
the grave, nothing in the present but an ignominious
death on the scaffold. Yet it was sweet to
die for one&#8217;s country; and, disgraceful as his end
might be in its form, it was still in the service of
the nation. He felt happy in the thought; and, if
there was nothing more on earth to hope for, there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
was still a bright heaven beyond the deepest and
darkest grave into which the hate of traitors could
plunge him, where the ruptured ties of this life
are again restored, never again to be subject to
change and decay.
</p>
<p>There was a tear in his eye as he thought of his
fond mother; and he wept for her when he could
not weep for himself. No one saw that tear, and
the officer permitted him to indulge his sad revery
in silence. But, after they had walked two or three
squares, his companion in authority suddenly
stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have left a book, which I carried in my hand,
at the depot,&#8221; said he, in tones full of chagrin at
his carelessness. &#8220;I must have it; for I can do
nothing without it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you leave it?&#8221; asked the soldier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the guard-room. You may go back, and
bring it to me. Give me your gun; you needn&#8217;t
carry that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall I find you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, where you leave me. Go quick, my
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be gone ten minutes,&#8221; replied the soldier,
as he started off at a run for the missing
volume.
</p>
<p>The officer took the gun, and stood by the side
of his prisoner, at the corner of the street, till the
soldier disappeared in the darkness. Somers, still
thinking of the sad fate which he was confident
was in store for him, wished to confirm his impressions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
in regard to his destiny. His companion
seemed to be a gentleman of a kindly nature,
though stern in the discharge of his duty. It was
possible that he would give him some information
in regard to the probable disposal of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me, sir, why I am separated from
the rest of the prisoners?&#8221; said he, as soon as the
sentinel had departed upon his errand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are an officer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I am?&#8221; asked Somers, very
desirous of ascertaining how much Captain de Banyan
had told in regard to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know all about you,&#8221; answered the officer,
muffling his cloak more closely around his face, as
if afraid the night air might injure his lungs as he
opened his mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t very definite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a word, you are Captain Thomas Somers, of
the &mdash;th regiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s of no consequence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is to be done with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I am only a prisoner of war?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You crossed the James River in disguise, and
went into our lines for the purpose of obtaining
information. I suppose you can put those two
things together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers&#8217;s worst fears were confirmed. He was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
to be tried as a spy, and De Banyan had told all
he knew about him. Before he had time to dwell
on the dark prospect any longer, the officer said he
was cold, and could not stand there any longer.
Taking his prisoner by the arm, he led him down
the cross-street. Somers was just thinking of an
attempt to bid his companion good-night, when
the latter spoke again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall catch my death from this night air,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Just before the battle of Magenta&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan!&#8221; exclaimed Somers.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>A FRIEND INDEED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hush, my dear boy! not a word!&#8221; said Captain
de Banyan in an impressive whisper, as he
led the way along the street.
</p>
<p>Somers made no reply; for he readily perceived
that the utmost caution was necessary, though he
did not understand the position of his friend, or
what complications there were in the situation.
He was filled with rejoicing at finding himself
again in the way of getting back to the Union
army. Of course, his feelings towards Captain de
Banyan, in spite of his antecedents in the Third
Tennessee, underwent a sudden and agreeable
change; and in the joy of his heart he was disposed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
to embrace his friend, and beg forgiveness for the
suspicions he had entertained of him.
</p>
<p>They had advanced but a short distance from
the main street, when they heard the clatter of
horses&#8217; hoofs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad,&#8221; said Captain de Banyan, as he
stopped to ascertain in what direction the horsemen
were going.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s bad?&#8221; demanded Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My absence has been discovered, I am afraid.
The provost-marshal has a section of cavalry to
run down Union prisoners who may escape. I
think they are after me; at any rate, we must be
very careful where we go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few moments later, a small party of horsemen
dashed down the street by which the captain was
conducting his retreat. It would prove fatal to
their hopes, if they were seen; and Captain de Banyan
entered the yard of a house, followed by his
companion. There was a stable on the premises;
and, without a special invitation from the owner,
they entered, making their way to the hay-loft,
which seemed to be the most promising place of
concealment. A horse in the stall below whinnied
when they reached the second floor, expecting, no
doubt, his morning rations of hay.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the fugitives, still more unfortunately
perhaps for the horse, there was very
little hay in the loft; so that a secure hiding-place
was not readily found. But, as it was no part of
the captain&#8217;s intention to remain long in this loft,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
they seated themselves on a grain chest, to wait
till the troopers should pass the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it, captain?&#8221; asked Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About four in the morning. We are rather
late. It will be daylight in about an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been since we parted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we parted, my boy? We didn&#8217;t part.
You did all the parting, Somers,&#8221; replied De Banyan
in a reproachful tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I did; but, after what I had heard, you
need scarcely wonder. You acknowledged that
you had been a rebel officer, and a member of the
Third Tennessee regiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I grant it; but I thought enough else was said
to enable you to understand my position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had some hopes that you were all right;
but I could not banish my fears. How could I
know that you had not been sent over on the other
side for the same purpose that we crossed the
James?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have known it, my dear fellow.
They don&#8217;t usually send men over on such business
whose loyalty is doubtful. You heard the captain
say that I had been suspected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did; but I could not fully understand your
position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you gave me the slip? Well, Somers,
I forgive you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure, if I had not been in doubt in regard
to what you were, I would not have left you,
even if I had been certain of hanging with you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know you wouldn&#8217;t, my boy. I confess there
were a great many dark things against me; but I
assure you I am a loyal and true man. I have suffered
more for the Union than you have; for I was
born in the sunny South, and all my friends and
neighbors went with the rebels. I had no alternative
but to go into the army, where my experience
in the Crimea, in Italy, and in Mexico, made me an
officer. I escaped as soon as I could, and enrolled
myself on the right side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers grasped the hand of his brave and devoted
companion, which he pressed with a warmth
that indicated his feelings more eloquently than
words could have done. He was entirely satisfied
with the explanation, because it was fully sustained
by the conduct of the captain, and by the
words of the rebel cavalry officer who had claimed
his acquaintance. He was even disposed to believe
that De Banyan had been a soldier in the
European wars and in Mexico; which was a degree
of credulity hardly to be expected of a sensible
young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will forgive me for my unjust suspicions,
captain? I assure you it went against my grain
to believe that you were a rebel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had good reason for it. I was more afraid
of you, when I confessed my sins to the rebel officer,
than I was of him. We are friends again,
Somers; that&#8217;s all I want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have proved yourself my friend by this
last act; and I should have needed no further explanation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
to convince me that you were a loyal
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all that, my dear boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been since I parted from
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got up to Petersburg in the afternoon. I was
put in that hole where I found you at first; but,
when the provost-marshal learned my story, he
sent for me, and I was conducted to his office.
Just as I came out of the depot, you went in. He
wanted to question me, he said. Well, I happened
to know him, though he did not know me. I knew
his weak point; and, in a word, I bamboozled him.
I assured him I was an officer in the Third Tennessee,
and that, on further inquiry, he would find
I was all right; that I had rendered greater service
to my country by going over to the Yankees
than I could possibly have done by remaining with
my regiment; which, you are willing to believe,
was strictly true.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked the privilege of putting on my uniform
again, which he granted; and, with the gold in
my pocket, I purchased a full fit-out of the quartermaster.
The provost-marshal told me that I
must report at Richmond, which I promised to do;
and, my dear boy, I hope I shall be able to do so
at no distant day, though it doesn&#8217;t look much like
it just now. He gave me an apartment next to
his office, for the night; where, of course, he expected
to find me in the morning. In the night, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
got up, and went into his office to transact a little
business on my own account.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After I saw you at the depot, my dear fellow,
I couldn&#8217;t forget your sad look. You seemed to
be as hopeless as a stray chicken in the wet grass,
and I was trying to think what I could do for you.
I couldn&#8217;t have gone back to Harrison&#8217;s Landing
without you; it would have broken my heart. And
what could I have said to the general, when he
asked for you? How could I have made my peace
with the officers of the regiment, if I had gone back
without you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very kind of you, after the shabby manner
in which I had treated you,&#8221; added Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the very reason why I was bound to
help you out of the scrape, if I could. I wanted to
set myself right with you. I wanted to convince
you I wasn&#8217;t the man you took me to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have convinced me in the fullest manner;
and I owe you a debt of gratitude which I shall
never be able to pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, my boy; we are not out of the scrape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter whether we get out of the scrape or
not, my feelings towards you will be just the
same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Somers; I am satisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where did you get the pass you gave the
corporal of the guard at the depot?&#8221; asked
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found the provost-marshal&#8217;s signature on
certain papers, one of which I filled out to suit myself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
But there was a sentinel at the door of the
office, put there, I suppose, for my benefit; though
I was sorry to trouble the poor fellow to stand
there on my account. My friend, the provost, had
done this little act in the most delicate way in the
world. He did not tell me that I was under guard;
but I happened to find out before I put my foot
in the trap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a word, not wishing to disturb the sentinel,
I took the liberty of leaving by the way of the
window of my chamber, instead of the door.
Luckily there was a one-story shop next to the
office; and with the aid of a blanket from my bed,
I dropped down upon it, without disturbing the
meditations of the sentinel or the slumbers of the
provost. I got into the street, and went to the
depot. There I told the corporal of the guard a
very interesting story about the prisoner who had
been brought up in the afternoon, meaning myself;
and that the man I wanted was needed immediately
as a witness. You know the rest, my dear fellow;
and here we are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And here we are likely to remain, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221;
added Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. I haven&#8217;t exhausted half my
expedients yet. On the night before the attack
on the Redan, at Sebastopol, I went all over that
city, and spent the evening at the house of one of
the most distinguished citizens&mdash;a gentleman who
had a government contract for rations. Of course,
he didn&#8217;t know me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! There is some one coming into the
stable below,&#8221; said Somers, as he heard a door
opened on the floor below.
</p>
<p>It was impossible to move then without making
noise enough to excite the attention of the person
who had entered; for the stable was old and
rickety, and the boards creaked at every step they
took. The fugitives listened with breathless interest
to the movements of the unwelcome visitor.
The horse whinnied again; and the person entered
the stall, and spoke to him. The sound of his
voice filled the occupants of the loft with consternation;
for evidently the speaker was not a negro
servant, as they had hoped and expected to find
him, but a white man, and one who used the
English language well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Jenny, there&#8217;s a job on hand for us;
and you must postpone your breakfast till we
catch the Yankee prisoners,&#8221; said the person, who,
the fugitives were now satisfied, was an officer of
the cavalry service.
</p>
<p>While De Banyan was telling his story, they
had heard some noise at the house; and they now
concluded that the party which had ridden up the
street had come to call this officer for duty. They
hoped that nothing would require him to pay a
visit to the loft, and that, like a good officer, he
would be as expeditious as possible in his preparations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are my prisoner, if he comes up-stairs,&#8221;
whispered De Banyan.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>Somers pressed the hand of his companion to
assure him that he understood his plan; and they
held their breath, in the intense anxiety of the
moment, for further developments. The present
seemed to be the turning point in the career of the
adventurers; and, if they could once escape from
the horns of this dilemma, skill and prudence
would conduct them in safety to the Union lines.
</p>
<p>The officer below, after he had politely informed
&#8220;Jenny&#8221; of the early movement, seemed to be in
no hurry to get into the saddle. He went out at
the door of the stable, and all was silent again,
except the voice of Jenny, who seemed to be protesting
against any movement before she had received
her customary feed of corn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Peters!&#8221; shouted the officer from the door,
&#8220;hurry up! The Yankees will get to the James
River before you get the saddle on my horse.
Where have you been?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was looking for my boots.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An orderly ought to wear his boots to bed with
him, if he can&#8217;t put them where he can find them,&#8221;
replied the officer, as the heavy step of another
man was heard in the stable below.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What news did you hear?&#8221; asked the officer,
as the orderly led the horse from the stall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sergeant said some officer that had been
took as a deserter done runned away,&#8221; replied
Peters, as the fugitives heard the rattle of the
saddle-gear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up, then!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He done took a Yankee prisoner from the
depot with him,&#8221; added Peters, who, if he had not
been called an orderly, the listeners would have
taken for a negro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may take a peck of corn in a bag for
Jenny, Peters. We may have a long ride of it,&#8221;
added the officer, as he left the stable.
</p>
<p>A peck of corn! De Banyan and Somers were
sitting on the grain chest! It was impossible to
avoid discovery; and De Banyan threw off his
cloak, ready for the emergency.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, my boy, we must change our tactics.
They have heard the whole story, and we can&#8217;t
blind them. We must make the best of it. Have
you a pistol?&#8221; whispered the captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; all I had was taken from me,&#8221; replied
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have only one. No matter; it would never
do to fire up here,&#8221; added De Banyan, as he picked
up a short pitch-fork which lay near him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to kill him?&#8221; asked Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s life or death for you and me! We can&#8217;t
stop for trifles,&#8221; answered the captain in hurried
tones, but still in a whisper.
</p>
<p>They listened for a moment longer to the quick
movements of Peters in the stable below. It was
evident that Jenny was duly caparisoned for service;
and then another horse was led out, which belonged
to the orderly. He was prepared for service
in less time than Jenny had required; and, a
moment later, the step of Peters was heard on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
stairs. With the bag in his hand, he was coming
up for the corn, as he had been ordered by the
officer. He did not see the fugitives till he had
reached the last step; when, as he was on the point
of opening his mouth to speak, De Banyan leveled
a blow at his head with the handle of the pitch-fork,
which felled him to the floor.
</p>
<p>He sank down upon the stairs stunned or dead;
and the captain, as though he had carefully matured
his plan beforehand, dragged the body to
one corner of the loft, where he covered it with
hay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word, Somers,&#8221; said he in an excited
whisper, as he crouched down behind the grain
chest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to stay here?&#8221; demanded
Somers, astonished at this singular disposition of
the forces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush&mdash;the officer is close by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With beating heart, Somers waited for the
further action of his resolute companion. It was
the most critical period of his life, it seemed to
him, especially as he did not fully comprehend the
purpose of De Banyan. Only a moment elapsed,
but it was long enough to be a week, before the
owner of Jenny returned to the stable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Peters! What are you about?&#8221; shouted he
angrily. &#8220;I shall never get off at this rate.
Peters!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peters was not in condition to answer the summons
at that moment. Somers hoped he was not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
dead; but he might as well have been dead, so far
as speaking was concerned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Peters!&#8221; shouted the officer again, with a string
of Southern Confederacy oaths; &#8220;where are you?
What are you about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Of course, the orderly could not answer; and
his silence only added to the rage of his master,
who continued to swear in a manner which must
have disgusted the gentle Jenny, and the other
respectable horse standing on the stable-floor.
</p>
<p>The officer rushed out of the stable, and the
heaviness of his step indicated the state of his
mind. He had gone to look for Peters; but, as
Peters was not outside, he must be inside; and
the officer entered again. He now walked towards
the stairs leading to the loft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Peters!&#8221; he continued to roar as he rushed up
the stairs. &#8220;Peters! this is your last day&#8217;s service
with me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the poor orderly was unable to remove the
stain which rested upon his fidelity. He still held
his peace; still silently submitted to the unjust imputations
on his character. The officer landed in
the loft just as Captain de Banyan rose to receive
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded he, as the stout
form of the captain confronted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your most obedient servant to command,&#8221; replied
De Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a Confederate officer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to be; but I am not. Be that as it may,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
your presence is dangerous to my health and
comfort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see: you are the deserter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am; but the future lies between you and me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will let the future speak for itself,&#8221;
answered the officer, drawing a pistol from his
belt. &#8220;Surrender, or you are a dead man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must positively decline the honor,&#8221; replied
De Banyan, as he swung the pitch-fork over his
head, and attempted to strike him down.
</p>
<p>He failed; and the officer fired, but without
effect. At that moment, Somers stepped forward
with a billet of wood he found on the floor. At
the same time, De Banyan raised the pistol; but
the rebel fired a second time before he could discharge
it. Somers instantly dropped his stick,
and his left arm fell to his side; the ball had passed
through it. De Banyan fired; the officer sank
down, not killed, but badly wounded.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>DR. SCOVILLE&#8217;S PATIENT</h3>
</div>

<p>The ball from De Banyan&#8217;s pistol had passed
through the right side of the officer; and he sank
upon the floor, the blood flowing copiously from
the wound. These proceedings were so irregular,
that Somers could not reconcile himself to them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
He was wounded himself; but, when the officer
fell, he was full of sympathy for him. It was evident
that the sufferer would bleed to death in a
short time, if left to himself without any attention;
and Somers could not endure the thought of letting
even an enemy die in this forsaken condition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, my boy; we have no time to lose. It&#8217;s
daylight now, and we ought to be five miles from
the city before this time,&#8221; said De Banyan, as he
moved towards the stairs. &#8220;Take the man&#8217;s pistol
and ammunition, and come along as fast as you
can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you leave this gentleman in this condition?&#8221;
asked Somers, gazing with pitying tenderness
at the pale face of the fallen officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him? Of course; we can&#8217;t take him with
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he will bleed to death if we leave him
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him bleed to death; I can&#8217;t help that.
Many a better man than he has bled to death since
this war began. Come along, Somers! What is
the matter with your arm?&#8221; demanded he, when
he saw that it hung useless at his side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit! We are lost, then!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we are not lost, either. I am not killed,&#8221;
replied Somers, whose arm was still numb from
the effect of the shot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a misfortune. I am afraid it will spoil
everything. Can you sit on a horse?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I can. But I can&#8217;t bear to let this
man die here alone. He is a brave fellow, and deserves
a better fate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Somers! You are an odd stick,
when you are wounded, to trouble yourself about
your enemies. Let me see your arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The captain examined the wounded member,
which was now bleeding very freely. He tied a
handkerchief around the arm, and did the best
which the circumstances would admit for his
friend. He then led the way down-stairs, where
the horses were impatiently waiting for their
riders. Jenny was a noble mare, and the orderly&#8217;s
horse was an excellent animal. De Banyan, knowing
how much might depend upon the endurance
of the horses in the flight before them, filled the
bag with corn in the loft, after he had helped
Somers to mount the horse of Peters, which appeared
to be the steadier beast of the two.
</p>
<p>The noise of the affray in the loft had probably
been heard by some of the occupants of the house;
and, just as the fugitives had mounted the horses,
a black woman from the dwelling approached the
stable. She gazed with astonishment and alarm
at the riders, and seemed to be satisfied that all
was not right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your master is up in the loft,&#8221; said Somers,
as they rode by her. &#8220;He is hurt, and wants attention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now whip up, Somers. We must make quick
time; for we shall have the whole city after us in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
ten minutes,&#8221; said De Banyan, as he urged Jenny
to the top of her speed.
</p>
<p>The spirited animal seemed as willing to exert
herself for the enemies as the friends of the Southern
Confederacy; thus proving that she was a neutral
horse, or cherished Union sentiments. But
the other horse could not keep pace with her, and
De Banyan was compelled to restrain her speed.
The fugitives had scarcely appeared in the street
before a hue and cry was raised; for the place had
been thoroughly aroused by the clamor which the
troopers had created. Still, there was nothing
in sight which promised to offer any serious resistance
to their progress.
</p>
<p>A few moments brought them to the outskirts
of the town; though in what direction, or to what
point, the road they had taken would lead them,
neither De Banyan nor Somers had the most remote
idea. To go in the wrong direction was
equivalent to plunging into certain ruin; to go in
any direction was hardly less perilous; for the rebel
cavalry was out upon every road, intent upon capturing
the deserter and the Yankee. As they
emerged from the more thickly settled parts of the
city, they discovered a negro approaching them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does this road lead to?&#8221; demanded De
Banyan, reining in his fiery steed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prince George&#8217;s Court House, massa,&#8221; replied
the man. &#8220;Wha&#8217; for you gwine down dar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>De Banyan was not disposed to answer any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
unnecessary questions, and again spurred on his
horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, massa!&#8221; shouted the negro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked De Banyan impatiently;
for, being a Southerner himself, he had
no particular respect for the negro race.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go down dar, massa.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Git cotched if you do, massa,&#8221; said the man
with an expressive grin. &#8220;De sodgers on de horses
is down dar arter you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know they are after us, you black
rascal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kase dey ax dis chile if he see two men, one ob
&#8217;em dressed like de &#8217;federate ossifer, and de odder
a Yank. Dis nigger didn&#8217;t see no sich pussons den;
but, golly, sees um now fur sartin. You done git
cotched as shore as you was born, massa, if you
go down dar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall we go, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno, massa; but you mustn&#8217;t be seen gwine
down dar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many soldiers did you meet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Four, sar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do, Somers. How is your arm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It begins to ache. We may as well go forward
as back,&#8221; said Somers, who was now suffering
severely from his wound, which had not been improved
by the hard gallop of the horse he rode.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who lives in that house?&#8221; demanded De Banyan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
of the negro, pointing to a splendid dwelling
a short distance ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Scoville, massa.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor?&#8221; replied the captain, glancing at
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sar; Dr. Scoville. Dat&#8217;s a mighty fine
mar you rides, massa. I reckon dat&#8217;s Captain
Sheffield&#8217;s mar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me, massa; dis chile&#8217;s a Union man
for shore,&#8221; grinned the negro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the negroes are Union men,&#8221; replied
Somers faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s so, massa!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Dr. Scoville?&#8221; asked De Banyan hopefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Secesh, massa&mdash;drefful secesh. He done been
in de army fur a surgeon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a dangerous man, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dar, massa, dar!&#8221; shouted the negro suddenly,
as he pointed down the road over which the fugitives
had just come. &#8220;Dey&#8217;s some more arter
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>De Banyan started his horse again, followed by
Somers; but it was evident from the appearance
of the latter that the chase was nearly finished for
him. He was beginning to feel very faint from the
loss of blood, while the pain of his wounded arm
was almost unsupportable. The gait of the horse
seemed to wrench the bones asunder, and cause
the shattered parts to grate against each other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up, Somers, my dear boy,&#8221; said his companion,
as he glanced back at the pale face of his
friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I can&#8217;t go much farther, De Banyan,&#8221;
replied Somers. &#8220;I am very faint. I feel
sick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up, and make one effort more. The
rebels are upon us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot. I shall fall from the horse, I am
afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t if I can help it; but the motion of the
horse almost kills me. Leave me, De Banyan; save
yourself if you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave you? I haven&#8217;t the remotest idea of
doing anything of the sort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better go on, and save yourself. It is all up
with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A mother would sooner leave her baby than I
would leave you,&#8221; replied De Banyan in tones as
tender as a woman&#8217;s. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never leave you,
Somers. If you go to Richmond, I shall go with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot do me any good. Save yourself before
it is too late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cease your blarney, my dear boy! We are one
flesh; and we will hang together to the end of life,
or <i>at</i> the end of it, as the case may be. Here,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
Somers, stick to your horse a moment more, and
we will call and see the doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Scoville!&#8221; exclaimed Somers, alarmed at
the idea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely he is a good surgeon. You are on
the sick-list now; mind what I say, and do just what
I tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>De Banyan, without stating what he intended
to do, dashed up the roadway leading to Dr. Scoville&#8217;s
house. It was evident that he was about to
resort to some desperate expedient to retrieve the
shattered fortunes of his party; but he kept his
own counsel; and Somers yielded himself to the
master will of his companion like a child, as indeed
he was in his exhausted and suffering condition.
The roadway led to the rear of the house
where the stable was located; and De Banyan
reined up his foaming steed as soon as he reached
the corner of the building.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep still a moment, Somers, and I&#8217;ll have you
taken care of,&#8221; said De Banyan, as he rode back
to a point where he could see the road without
being seen.
</p>
<p>It was evident that they had been observed by
the party of horsemen which had just come out of
the city; and he wished to ascertain whether they
had seen him turn in at the doctor&#8217;s premises.
The pursuers (for every mounted man was a pursuer
on that eventful morning) were riding in
every direction in search of the fugitives. He
hoped they would pass by, satisfied that any person
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
who should boldly call upon Dr. Scoville must
be a rebel.
</p>
<p>He was disappointed. When the party reached
the road, they reined up their horses; and De Banyan,
without losing a moment, dismounted, fastened
Jenny to a post in the yard, and ran down to
intercept the troopers. The captain walked with
the quick, sharp, consequential tramp of a military
commander; and, when the soldiers saw him, they
involuntarily saluted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing up here?&#8221; he demanded
in tones of authority.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking for the prisoners that runned
away,&#8221; replied a corporal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, do you expect to find them in the dwelling-house
of Dr. Scoville? Ride down the road as
fast as you can, and turn to the first left. If you
meet the major, report Captain Sheffield badly
wounded&mdash;shot by one of the prisoners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the prisoners have gone down this way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly they have. Off with you as fast as
you can!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The corporal saluted, wheeled his horse, and
dashed off, followed by the rest of the party. De
Banyan wiped away the cold sweat from his brow,
and returned to his suffering companion. He
helped him to dismount and seated him on a block
while he secured the horse. By this time, a couple
of negro women came out of the house. They
were the early risers of the family, and at once
manifested the most abundant sympathy for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
sufferer. The doors of the house were thrown
wide open to him; and Captain de Banyan, supporting
Somers, followed the servants into the sitting-room,
where the patient was laid upon the sofa
in a fainting condition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now call your master,&#8221; said De Banyan, with
as much assurance as though he had been the lord
of the manor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, massa,&#8221; replied one of the women as she
hastened to obey the order.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel, my dear boy?&#8221; said De Banyan,
bending over his charge.
</p>
<p>But Somers was past answering. He had
fainted from loss of blood and the agony of his
wound. The resolute captain did not wait for Dr.
Scoville in this emergency; but, taking a bottle of
cologne from the mantel, he applied himself with
skill and vigor to the restoration of his patient.
While he was thus engaged, the doctor made his
appearance. He was a man of fifty, of forbidding
aspect and rough exterior.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, sir?&#8221; demanded he in brusk
tones, placing himself in front of the captain, and
without bestowing more than a glance at the patient
on the sofa.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Sheffield,&#8221; replied De Banyan as
sharply as the question had been put.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you, indeed? Then you have altered a
great deal since I saw you yesterday,&#8221; added Dr.
Scoville, with an expression of malignant triumph
on his face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>This reply was a damper on any little scheme
which the over-confident De Banyan had proposed
to carry out; but the captain was a profound student
in the mysteries of human nature, and at once
correctly read the character of the gentleman who
stood before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t see me yesterday, and you know you
didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he replied in tones hardly less savage than
those of his involuntary host.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very true; I did not,&#8221; said the doctor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This point settled, I&#8217;ll thank you to turn to
the next one, which is the patient before you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a plain-spoken man,&#8221; added Dr. Scoville,
still gazing intently into the face of the captain;
who, however, returned the look as resolutely
and as earnestly as it was given.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am; I don&#8217;t waste words when my friend is
dying, for aught I know. Will you attend to this
man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a man shot through the arm, and needing
instant surgical attendance,&#8221; answered De
Banyan impatiently. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary to know
any more before you examine him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed the doctor with a smile
such as that in which a hyena might be supposed
to indulge when pleased, if hyenas ever are pleased.
</p>
<p>He turned to Somers, and proceeded to examine
into his condition. The coat of the patient was
removed from his insensible form, and he was carefully
disposed on the sofa, according to the directions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
of the doctor; the captain and the negro
women assisting in the work. Though the surgeon
was as rough as a bear in his tone and manner, he
was as tender as a loving mother in his treatment
of the sufferer, and handled him as carefully as
though he had been a new-born babe. The blood
was stanched, and the wound dressed as skilfully
as human hands and human knowledge could perform
the operation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of him?&#8221; asked De Banyan,
full of anxiety for his suffering companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t die just yet; but he may lose his
arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens! do you think so?&#8221; exclaimed
the captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say so for, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say he would lose his arm?&#8221; demanded
De Banyan savagely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said he might lose his arm. You may lose
your arm; but I think you are more likely to lose
your head. Who is this young man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a friend of mine; and, as I find it necessary
to be entirely candid with an old fellow like
you, I shall answer no questions in regard to him
at present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a question, Dr. Scoville. I intend to have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
him stay at your house till he is able to join his
regiment; and I intend to stay with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do me unmerited honor by making my
humble house your home,&#8221; said the doctor satirically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are worthy of the honor, Dr. Scoville.
As your humble house, I think it is very well
got up, creditable to your taste, and altogether a
fine place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; growled the host. &#8220;I suppose
you have no objection to my informing the Confederate
States military officers in the city of your
presence here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the slightest,&#8221; answered De Banyan
promptly. &#8220;I propose to inform them myself in
due time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say your name was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Sheffield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Petersburg?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not of Petersburg?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; of Nashville, Tennessee, which I can
further inform you is the capital of the State. I
have the honor to be a captain in the Third Tennessee.
I served in Mexico, in the Crimea, and in
Italy. I was present at four battles in the Crimea,
seven in Italy, five in Mexico; I have been engaged
in nine battles of the present war, and have been
wounded six times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you ever killed?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never was so unfortunate. Can I furnish you
with any further information?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No more at present,&#8221; replied the doctor, compressing
his lips, apparently to keep from laughing,
but really because he could not think of anything
sharp enough to dash so ready a talker. &#8220;If
you do me the honor to remain here a week, I shall
have better opportunities of hearing your marvelous
experience, Captain Sheffield. Ah, what have
we here?&#8221; continued he as three horsemen galloped
up the roadway.
</p>
<p>A violent knocking was presently heard at the
side door of the house, and Dr. Scoville hastened
to learn the errand of the excited visitors.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>DE BANYAN AT WORK</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;How do you feel, my dear boy?&#8221; asked Captain
de Banyan as soon as the doctor had left the
room.
</p>
<p>Somers, by the skilful applications of the physician,
had been restored to consciousness, and had
listened with astonishment, not unmingled with
alarm, to the last part of the conversation between
his friend and their host.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel a little better, captain; at any rate, I
am more comfortable,&#8221; replied Somers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it. I have been terribly
worried about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I shall do well enough. But what shall
I say for myself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say nothing, Somers&mdash;not a word. Don&#8217;t
commit yourself to anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you told him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing; and I don&#8217;t intend to tell him anything.
He is a jolly old fellow, who thinks he is
very eccentric, and takes pride in being considered
so. When I was in the Crimea&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the Crimea now,&#8221; interrupted
Somers with a languid smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only going to say that I understand the
old doctor first-rate, and can manage him as easily
as I could an old plow-horse. Keep still, Somers;
don&#8217;t let on, under any circumstances. Leave me
to do all the talking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the cavalry are after us now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind; the doctor will take care of
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will recognize our horses, if they don&#8217;t
know us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter if they do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers thought it was matter; and he could not
see for the life of him how De Banyan was to get
out of such a scrape as this; for it was an infinitely
worse one than his own experience on the Williamsburg
road. He could only hope for the best,
expecting nothing but disaster.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Bully for the doctor!&#8221; exclaimed De
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
Banyan as the sounds of an excited controversy at
the side door reached the ears of the patient and
his friend. &#8220;He is doing just what I expected him
to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray, what did you expect him to do?&#8221; asked
Somers, who could not see what a rebel surgeon
could be expected to do under the circumstances,
besides delivering them up to the military authorities.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect him to protect us to the utmost of his
ability; and, in my opinion, he has quite as much
influence as any other man in Petersburg. When
you see a man like Dr. Scoville, you may depend
upon it he is a power in the community where he
lives. He knows it as well as any other person.
Let the doctor alone, and he will manage the
matter as skilfully as he dressed your wounded
arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whatever confidence Captain de Banyan had in
the will and the ability of Dr. Scoville to protect
them, he was curious to hear what the soldiers and
what the doctor had to say. He was not quite
willing to be seen by the rebel soldiers; so he
passed quickly into the entry, and took a position
where he could hear without being observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who I am, you villain?&#8221; demanded
the doctor, in tones so full of rage, that
the troopers ought to have been annihilated,
though it appears that they were not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care who you are; I want the men that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
came here an hour ago,&#8221; replied one of the
troopers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Jeff Davis himself came for them, he
couldn&#8217;t have them!&#8221; roared Dr. Scoville.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, sir, one of them is a deserter, and
the other is a Yankee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what they are. Report my answer
to the provost-marshal; tell him Dr. Scoville
will be responsible for the safety of the men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t report any such answer to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If a man of you attempts to enter my house,
I&#8217;ll shoot him!&#8221; replied the doctor, taking a rifle
from a nail in the entry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir; if you can shoot any better than
we can, you may begin,&#8221; said the soldier. &#8220;But,
as sure as you fire, you are a dead man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And those of you whom I don&#8217;t shoot will be
hung as soon as you report the death of Dr. Scoville
at headquarters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whatever the soldiers thought, they were not
willing to assume the responsibility of shooting a
man like the doctor, whose splendid mansion was
a guaranty of his wealth and high standing, and
whose strong words assured them that he was a
man of influence. Even the possibility of being
hanged in such a cause was not agreeable to contemplate;
and the doctor carried the day against
his assailants.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to shoot you, Dr. Scoville; but I
shall put a guard over your house, and wait for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
further orders,&#8221; said the soldier, who appeared to
be a sergeant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do anything you please; but don&#8217;t you enter
my house. Every man, woman and child here is
under my protection,&#8221; replied the doctor, as he
restored the rifle to its original position; and the
troopers retired from the door.
</p>
<p>Captain de Banyan withdrew from the hall, and
joined Somers in the sitting-room, where he was
immediately followed by the doctor. The situation
did not look very hopeful, even to a man of
such desperate fortunes as the bold Tennessean.
The house was surrounded by rebel soldiers, and a
report of the case would probably be made to the
provost-marshal; therefore it was not at all likely
that the doughty doctor could long remain contumacious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, my mysterious friend, you are a Confederate
deserter, are you?&#8221; said the doctor, as he
placed himself in front of the captain, thrust his
hands deep down into the pockets of his pants, and
stared at his guest with all the vigor of an active
and piercing eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that I am; but I adhere to my original
resolution, to say nothing at present,&#8221; replied De
Banyan, returning the gaze of the doctor as earnestly
as it was given.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were Abe Lincoln himself, you are safe
in my house,&#8221; said the doctor after a long pause.
&#8220;But I wish you to understand clearly and precisely
what I mean. I am not the man to shield a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
deserter or a Yankee from the penalty due to his
crimes. You came into my house with a wounded
man. I am an Arab on the subject of hospitality.
Whoever comes into my house is my guest; and I
never betrayed a man who trusted in me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t thank me, for I despise you from
the deepest depths of my heart; and in due time
you will fall into the hands of the military authorities,
but not in my house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Dr. Scoville. I appreciate your
hospitality, and despise you as much as you do
me,&#8221; answered De Banyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Despise me! How dare you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I dare do anything; and I beg leave to
inform you that neither myself nor my friend will
fall into the hands of the soldiers, either in your
house or outside of it. You can set your mind
entirely at ease on that subject.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am tempted for once to violate even my own
law of hospitality.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please, doctor; that matter is for you
to consider, not for me. But I beg you to understand
precisely what I say. I am very thankful
to you for your kindness; and I assure you that
whatever you do and say, I shall remember your
hospitality with the most grateful emotions. I
speak for myself and for my friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dr. Scoville seemed to be very much perplexed,
as the captain evidently intended he should be;
and, turning abruptly from the deserter, he paced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
the room, rapidly and in silence, for several minutes.
De Banyan sat down by the side of Somers,
and said a great many comforting things to him,
which, in his weak and suffering condition, were
as grateful as a woman&#8217;s smile at the couch of
pain.
</p>
<p>Breakfast was ready, and with the utmost politeness
the doctor conducted his guest to the table,
while one of the black women was ordered to supply
the wants of the patient on the sofa. During
the meal, not a word was said about the war, or
the peculiar circumstances under which the patient
and his friend had come to the house. The captain
discoursed about the wars in other lands, and
it is more than probable that he exercised the
credulity of the doctor to the utmost. Both the
host and the guest were affable to the last degree;
for the choleric physician was conscious that he
had more than a match in the other.
</p>
<p>After breakfast, Somers was conducted to the
guest-chamber on the second floor of the mansion.
He was as tenderly cared for by the doctor and the
servants as though he had been an honored friend,
instead of a hunted enemy. In the course of the
forenoon, Dr. Scoville received a visit from the
provost-marshal, attended by half a company of
cavalry. Of course, the captain was exceedingly
curious to know the result of this interview, which
was conducted in the most courteous manner;
and he was so impolite as to play the part of a
listener. The officer was informed that Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
Sheffield had been dangerously wounded by the
fugitives; but the eccentric physician positively
refused to have his guests taken from his house,
assuring the provost-marshal that he would be
responsible for their safe-keeping, and offered to
board a dozen men who should be employed in
guarding them. The officer protested in gentlemanly
terms against such a course; but it was evident
that the doctor was the greatest man in
Petersburg, and must have his own way.
</p>
<p>The result of the conference was, that the provost-marshal
yielded the point, and a sentinel was
placed at the door of Somers&#8217;s chamber, to which
the captain had retreated. The officer visited the
room, and fully identified his prisoner, between
whom and himself a sharp conversation ensued,
much to the amusement of the doctor. The captain
was assured that in due time, he should
swing, which pleasant information he received
with becoming good nature, promising to be present
when the exciting event should take place.
The provost-marshal retired, satisfied with the precautions
he had taken.
</p>
<p>For the following three days, the sentinel at the
door, with a loaded musket in his hand, kept guard
over his prisoners. Somers had improved rapidly,
though by the advice of his managing friend, he
pretended to be much worse than he really was.
Dr. Scoville, though he still kept his word and
maintained his position with regard to the prisoners,
continually &#8220;thorned&#8221; the captain with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
prospect of the gallows, which he declared was
his certain doom. De Banyan still preserved his
equanimity, and still declared that he should never
be hanged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you intend to do?&#8221; asked Somers on
the third day of his confinement, after the doctor
had taunted his guest with more than usual
severity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea, my dear boy,&#8221; replied
the captain with a grim smile. &#8220;So far, I have
no plans. When you are able to move, Somers,
we will see what can be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can move now; you need not delay a single
hour on my account. I am all right but my arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>De Banyan was by no means as cheerful as he
appeared to be. He was troubled, and paced the
room with uneasy tread; but, the moment the doctor
entered the room, he was as gay as a Broadway
beau. Somers had vainly attempted to persuade
him to make his own escape, and leave him to his
fate; but the brave fellow steadily refused to desert
him under any circumstances that could possibly
present themselves.
</p>
<p>The captain was remarkably still for him, after
Somers had convinced him that he was able to
move. He paced the room as before; but his eyes
were glancing uneasily at the floor, the ceiling,
and the walls of the apartment. The work had
commenced in his mind; and Somers watched his
movements with interest, yet without hope. On
one side of the fire-place in the room there was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
door, which was locked, but which evidently
opened into a closet.
</p>
<p>Before this door, De Banyan suddenly came to
a dead halt. He examined it with the utmost care;
and then with a fork from the breakfast things
which had not been removed, he commenced operations
upon the lock. One of the prongs of the
fork was broken off between two bricks in the fire-place,
and the other bent; so that the instrument
formed a very good pick-lock. The door was
opened without the expenditure of much time or
patience; and the captain proceeded to explore
the interior of the closet, after instructing his fellow-prisoner
to give him timely warning of any
movement on the part of the sentinel.
</p>
<p>Somers did not see the captain again for half an
hour, but when he came out he looked as though
he had endured the tortures of a month of suspense;
but, with a ghastly smile, he told his companion
that the hour for action had come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, captain?&#8221; demanded
Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us use haste; we shall have more time to
talk to-morrow, when we get back to the camp on
the other side of the James River. Are you very
sure that you can stand the fatigue of a long
walk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come with me; but a particle of noise
will be fatal to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>De Banyan led the way to the closet; but, before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
he entered himself, he tied together the two sheets
of the bed, and made one end fast to one of the
bed-posts, near a window at the end of the house,
which he opened without noise. Dropping the
sheet out, he retreated to the closet, and with the
pick-lock secured the door. They were in darkness
now, and seating themselves on the floor, with
palpitating hearts they waited the issue. For
more than an hour they waited the expected alarm.
They could occasionally hear a movement on the
part of the sentinel in the entry; but he probably
thought it was foolish to be very vigilant over a
man so sick as Somers. But the demonstration
came at last; and the prisoners, sweltering in the
confined air of the closet, listened with breathless
interest to the shouts of the soldiers outside, and
to the rapid steps of those within the mansion.
</p>
<p>The doctor and the sentinel entered the chamber
so lately occupied by the prisoners. The former
swore in no measured terms at the faithlessness of
the sentry at the door, and at the stupidity of those
who guarded the house outside. But they seemed
to have no doubt as to the manner of the escape.
</p>
<p>There was the open window, and the rope made
of the bed-linen, which De Banyan had pulled with
his hands till it had the appearance of having sustained
a great weight. Dr. Scoville did not even
try the door of the closet; and the anxious listeners
soon had the pleasure of hearing the sounds of
horses&#8217; hoofs, as the cavalry rode off to engage in
the search for the fugitives.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></p>
<p>Everything about the house soon subsided into
the most profound quiet, and it was evident that
the doctor and all the soldiers were engaged in
the search. After this solemn stillness had continued
for a time, they heard the voices of the
servants in the chamber. They talked about the
escape, and all of them expressed a hope that
&#8220;poor young massa would get out ob de way.&#8221;
Here was an opportunity for an alliance, offensive
and defensive, which the prudent captain could not
reject. Carefully opening the door, he presented
himself to the astonished negroes. With considerable
difficulty, he hushed their noisy exclamations,
and opened the case so eloquently, that all three
of them readily promised to help the fugitives in
making their escape. They grinned with delight
when they comprehended the trick by which the
doctor and the soldiers had been put on the wrong
scent.
</p>
<p>With their assistance, the fugitives left the
house, and made their way to the stable, where
Alick, the man who had waited upon them in the
room, raised a plank in the floor, and introduced
them to secure but not very comfortable quarters
under the building. There was no cellar under
the stable, and the space which they occupied was
not more than two feet in height; but what it
lacked in this direction, it made up in length and
width.
</p>
<p>When the fugitives were fairly installed in their
new hiding-place, Alick sat down on the floor, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
told them all he knew about the events which had
transpired since their absence had been discovered.
He brought them an abundant supply of food and
drink, and promised to provide them with horses
as soon as it was dark. It was nearly night before
the doctor returned; and while attending to
his horse, Alick asked him some questions about
the chase. He was not very communicative, for,
of course, the pursuit had been unsuccessful; but
the ingenious black wormed some facts out of him
in regard to the events of the day, which enabled
him to be of great assistance to the fugitives.
</p>
<p>The doctor had hardly gone into the house before
Alick commenced his preparations for departure;
and three horses instead of two were in
readiness when Somers and the captain emerged
from their covert. Alick was to be one of the
party; and by the fields in the rear of the house
they commenced their perilous journey.
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER COMMISSION</h3>
</div>

<p>The horses which De Banyan and Somers rode
were those taken from the stable of Captain Sheffield,
which had not yet been removed from Dr.
Scoville&#8217;s stable; while that on which Alick was
mounted was one of the best of his master&#8217;s stock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
The party proceeded through the fields for a short
distance till they came to a cross-road, when they
put their horses to the top of their speed. The
guide was familiar with all the roads in the
vicinity. The information which he had obtained
from the doctor was exceedingly valuable; for it
assured the fugitives in what direction the search
for them had been pushed.
</p>
<p>Dr. Scoville believed that the prisoners were
concealed in the vicinity of the city, and that at
night they would attempt to make their way in
the direction of City Point; and he assured Alick
that they would certainly be caught before morning,
for the country in that region was strongly
picketed by cavalry. It is more than probable they
would have been taken if the doctor had not been
so obliging as to inform Alick of these facts. The
faithful black, who had served his master, man and
boy, for forty years, was entitled to this consideration.
Of course, he could not have believed that
Alick would be so ungrateful and ungenerous as
to run away from him; but it is a fact which speaks
well for the negro race, that so many have preferred
liberty with toil and hardship to slavery
with ease and plenty.
</p>
<p>Somers had over-estimated his power of endurance;
and a hard gallop of five miles was about
the extent of his capacity. The rude jolting of
his arm made it extremely painful, while his
system, reduced by the fever attending the wound,
was incapable of supporting such a heavy draft
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
upon his strength. He bore up against the pain
and faintness which beset him as long as he could;
but at last, to the oft-repeated inquiries of Captain
de Banyan in regard to his condition, he was compelled
to answer in the most discouraging terms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must stop and rest,&#8221; said the captain.
&#8220;We have about fifteen miles more to go; and you
mustn&#8217;t break down yet, Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, massa, take some of this,&#8221; said Alick, as
he reined in his horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Somers faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brandy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t drink brandy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will do you good, my dear boy. There is
strength in brandy&mdash;only as medicine. Don&#8217;t be
stubborn, Somers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good brandy, massa,&#8221; added Alick. &#8220;I
brought it along on purpose for you. I was mighty
feared you wouldn&#8217;t be able to stand the ride.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to take it if it will do me any
good,&#8221; said Somers. &#8220;I am about used up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sufferer drank two or three swallows of the
fiery liquid from the bottle after he had dismounted.
The potion gave him an artificial life,
which enabled him to ride five miles farther,
though at a much slower pace than before. The
roads seemed to be entirely deserted, and the party
felt satisfied that they had passed out of the reach
of a successful pursuit. Another dose of brandy
gave Somers strength enough to accomplish fifteen
miles of the journey; but at this point he was absolutely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
unable to sit on his horse. With the assistance
of De Banyan, he got off and lay for two
hours on the ground, where his devoted companions
made him a bed of their coats. Alick produced
some bacon and crackers, which he had
brought for an emergency, of which Somers partook
in small quantities. Pressed by his fellow-fugitives,
he again drank some brandy; and while
his head was flying round like a top, his friends
placed him on the horse again.
</p>
<p>In the overpowering weakness and suffering of
the hour, Somers had begged his companions to
leave him to his fate; but De Banyan declared that
he would be hanged a dozen times before he would
do so mean and wicked an act. With the fumes
of the brandy darting in every direction through
his brain, which seemed to be about fifty feet above
his shoulders, he spurred on his horse. The liquor
had inspired him to a kind of desperation. He
hardly knew what he was about, and even forgot
the pain of his wounded arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; shouted De Banyan, as the party
dashed over a rude bridge extending across a broad
creek. &#8220;Halt, Somers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Somers heeded not the word, and still
spurred on, till the captain, who rode the fastest
animal, could overtake him. He succeeded in stopping
the furious rider, and in making him understand
that they had reached the end of their journey
in this direction. They returned to the bridge,
where the sharp eye of the captain had discerned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
a boat moored to a tree, a short distance below the
road. Somers, still stupefied by the effects of the
brandy, tamely submitted to whatever disposition
his companions chose to make of him. Taking off
their coats, they made for him a bed in the bottom
of the boat, which was a large yawl, evidently used
for conveying merchandise to some point farther
up the creek. The horses were turned loose, and
the captain and Alick took the oars.
</p>
<p>After pulling for half an hour, they were rewarded
by a view of the broad river which to them
was like the Land of Promise; and moored in the
middle there was a steamer, which in those waters
could belong to no other party than the United
States Government. They rowed out to this vessel,
and hailed her. Of course they were cordially
welcomed after a satisfactory explanation had been
given.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory hallelujah! How do you feel, Somers?&#8221;
said Captain de Banyan, after he had insured a
proper reception on board of the steamer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Badly, very badly,&#8221; replied Somers faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, cheer up, my boy! We have got home
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Home!&#8221; said Somers, raising himself partially
up at the sound of that magical word.
</p>
<p>The captain and Alick lifted him tenderly, and
assisted him up the accommodation-ladder of the
steamer. The vessel was a gunboat bound up the
river, and was waiting for the daylight. Somers
was taken to the ward-room, where the surgeon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
dressed his arm, and prescribed for his bodily ailments.
Alick was duly installed as his nurse,
though Captain de Banyan performed the greater
part of his duty. But the consciousness that he
was again beneath the old flag did more for the
patient than even the assiduous care of his devoted
friends.
</p>
<p>After leaving Petersburg the fugitives had pursued
a nearly easterly course till they arrived at
the bridge over Chipoak Creek, where they had
abandoned their horses, and taken the boat. Alick
had chosen this direction to avoid the pickets
which were on the lookout for them in the vicinity
of the City Point Railroad. His calculations had
been well made, and he was rewarded for his zeal
and skill by the priceless boon of freedom, which
he preferred even to the life of comfort and ease
he had enjoyed beneath the roof of his kind but
eccentric master.
</p>
<p>How Dr. Scoville ever made his peace with the
provost-marshal of Petersburg we are not informed;
but we will venture to say that his whims
were not respected after the events we have narrated.
He was a wilful man; but his guests were
very sorry to be compelled to make him such an
ungenerous return for his noble hospitality. When
the war is ended, and he is enabled fully to understand
the meaning of treason to our beneficent Government,
no doubt he will be very thankful that
his prisoner guests escaped as they did.
</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock on the following morning, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
gunboat dropped her anchor off Harrison&#8217;s Landing.
Somers, who had slept for several hours, was
more comfortable, though he was still in a deplorable
condition. With the kindly assistance of his
friends, he was landed at the pier, and conveyed
in an ambulance to the headquarters of the division.
Leaning on the arm of De Banyan, he entered
the tent of the general.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Somers!&#8221; exclaimed the general. &#8220;I
had given you up for lost. Why, you have grown
ten years older in five days!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the honor to make my report, general,&#8221;
said Somers with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your report? Good! After losing you, I did
not dare to send another officer upon such a perilous
errand. But, Captain Somers, you are all
used up,&#8221; added the general, with a glance filled
with sympathy&mdash;a look which Somers regarded as
an adequate reward for all he had suffered; for
to have <i>that</i> man feel an interest in him was better
in his estimation than the plaudits of the multitude.
&#8220;What is the matter with your arm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was shot at Petersburg,&#8221; replied Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, captain, you must go to the hospital:
and Captain&mdash;what&#8217;s-his-name&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan, at your service,&#8221; promptly
responded Somers&#8217;s faithful friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain de Banyan shall report for you, and
tell me all about this scrape,&#8221; added the general.
&#8220;Get into your carriage, Captain Somers, and go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
to the hospital. I will call and see you to-day or
to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, general.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Captain de Banyan assisted him into the ambulance;
and, when he had placed him in the care
of the surgeon, he returned to headquarters to tell
the marvelous story of their capture by the rebels,
and their escape from Petersburg. It is quite
likely that he did not add his experience in Tennessee;
but when the general called on Somers at
the hospital the next morning, the latter supplied
all that had been withheld. The general had a
higher regard for the captain&#8217;s patriotism than
ever before, for he had voluntarily renounced the
ranks of the rebellion, and placed himself on the
side of his country. There was nothing against
him; on the contrary, his conduct had been in the
highest degree praiseworthy. But Captain de Banyan
was sensitive on this point; and the general
readily promised to conceal what the brave fellow
regarded as a stain upon his character.
</p>
<p>Captain Somers did not improve so rapidly as
his friends desired. The surgeon declared that his
night ride from Petersburg, in his feeble condition,
had done him more injury than a year&#8217;s hard service;
and after he had been in the hospital ten days,
it was deemed advisable to give him a furlough,
and send him home, especially as the division was
then under orders to march to Yorktown. The
gallant young hero regretted the necessity of leaving
the regiment just as he had been promoted;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
but he was in no condition to endure the long and
weary march. He was able to walk about a little;
and on the day before the sailing of the transport
by which he was to proceed to Washington, he
received another visit from the general.
</p>
<p>After a few kind inquiries in regard to the invalid&#8217;s
condition, the general took from his pocket
one of those great official envelopes which so often
carry joy to the heart of the gallant officer. Somers
was amazed. It could not be possible that his
own promotion was indicated by this document.
It was not three weeks since his commission as
captain had reached him; but then Senator Guilford
was a great man, and wielded a tremendous
influence, both at Washington, and with the military
authorities of his native State.
</p>
<p>Recalling his former declaration to Captain de
Banyan, he was fully resolved to decline any further
promotion, at least until he had done something
which entitled him to this distinction. The
general held up the formidable packet, while
Somers&#8217;s pale face was suffused with blushes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have brought you a major&#8217;s commission,
Somers; and I know it will give you joy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, sir; ah! general, I don&#8217;t think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; laughed the general.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve it, general; and you will pardon
me if I say I cannot accept it. I am very
grateful to you; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t for you!&#8221; roared the general as he
handed him the official paper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Major de Banyan!&#8221; exclaimed Captain Somers
as he read the superscription with a thrill of delight.
&#8220;It is indeed a joy to me. I am ten times
as happy as I should have been if my own name
had been coupled with that title. I am ever so
much obliged to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator Guilford again! By the way, Captain
Somers, you must call on him when you get
to Washington.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall certainly do so. But I know my friend
could not have been promoted without the good
word which you have spoken for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is all right, captain. Major de Banyan
is a brave fellow. He has done you a good
turn; and I waylaid this document so as to afford
you the pleasure of being the first to address him
by his new title.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, general.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, captain, if you could prevail on the
major to be a little more reasonable in some of
the lies he tells, his reputation for veracity would
be improved.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will endeavor to do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The general bade the invalid a hearty and even
affectionate adieu; and they did not meet again till
they grasped hands on the bloody field of Antietam,
where Somers acted in a new sphere of duty.
No sooner had the general departed, than Somers,
inspired to new vigor by the joyful event which
had just transpired, hastened to the camp of the
regiment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Somers; my dear boy! how are you now?&#8221;
said his friend as he seized his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better, I thank you, <i>Major</i> de Banyan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now, Somers, that is cruel! A friend
of mine, just before the battle of Solferino&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound the battle of Solferino, Major de
Banyan!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about to say that a friend of mine, just
before the battle of Solferino, made fun of my
aspirations, just as you do now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t do anything of the sort. Here&#8217;s the
official document. If I read right, it says Major
de Banyan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers,&#8221; said the captain, winking very
rapidly to dissipate some evidences of weakness
which were struggling for existence in his eyes&mdash;&#8220;Somers,
you have done this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did write to Senator Guilford about you before
we went over the river; and now I thank God
with all my soul that I did so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somers, you are one of the best of friends!&#8221;
exclaimed the major as he stood with the unopened
document in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so are you. Without you, I should have
been in a rebel prison or under the sod at this
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, Somers!&#8221; ejaculated De Banyan,
as with trembling hand he opened the envelope,
and took therefrom his major&#8217;s commission.
&#8220;I have loved you just like a younger
brother; not selfishly, my dear boy, but with my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
whole heart. You haven&#8217;t disappointed me, only
once, when&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. I thought you were a rebel
then, but I repented.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you. Now, Somers, you are
going home. May God bless you and keep you!
I shall be as sad as a maiden who has lost her
lover, while you are gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not be absent long. We shall be together
again in a few weeks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so. I have no home now. It has been
desolated by treason. I heard since I came over
that my wife was dead. I had a son, a boy of
fifteen; I know not where he is. Well, well; I will
not groan or complain. I will do my duty to my
country, and that shall cheer my heart;&#8221; and with
an effort of his powerful will, he banished the sad
reflections from his mind, and smiled as though
earth had no sorrows. &#8220;After the battle of Magenta,
I had the blues, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One word, De Banyan. <i>Were</i> you at the
battle of Magenta?&#8221; said Somers solemnly.
</p>
<p>The major looked on the ground, at the commission
he had just received, and then into the sympathizing
face of his friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, Somers, I was not; but I
fought in every battle in Mexico, from Vera Cruz
up to the capital.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somers improved this opportunity to repeat the
injunction of the general.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now promise me, major, that you will never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
say Magenta or anything of the sort again as long
as you live,&#8221; added Somers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a rash promise. I have got a
bad habit, and I will try to cure myself of it. On
my soul I will, my dear boy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the course of the conversation the major, who
was now in a truth-telling mood, informed Somers
that he had, after his escape from the rebel army,
enlisted in the regular army, where he had been
made a sergeant, and, through the influence of a
Massachusetts officer, had been commissioned as
a captain. His gallantry had won a swift reward.
</p>
<p>On the following day they parted on board the
transport in the river; and in that sad hour the
friendship which, though brief in duration, had
been fruitful enough for a lifetime, was pledged
for the future. They parted, De Banyan to mingle
in the terrible scenes in which the regiment was engaged
before the close of the month, and Somers
to bask in the smiles of the loved ones at home.
Alick, who had been regularly installed as the
captain&#8217;s servant, went with him.

<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>WASHINGTON, BOSTON AND PINCHBROOK</h3>
</div>

<p>Though the session of Congress had closed a
month before, Captain Somers was gratified to
learn on his arrival that Senator Guilford and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
his family were still in Washington, the distinguished
gentleman having been detained by important
public business. As soon as he could make
himself presentable, he hastened to pay his respects
to the Senator, and thank him for his kindness.
He was not at home. Emma received him with a
warm blush of pleasure on her fair cheeks. She
had entirely recovered from the effects of the accident;
and her tribute of gratitude was so eloquently
poured forth, that the gallant young captain,
who had hardly seen a young lady before
for two months, could not exactly tell whether he
stood on his head or his heels; for praise from
those beautiful lips produced a sensation of giddiness
in the region of the brain.
</p>
<p>Young men will be silly in spite of all we dignified
old fogies can say to convince them of the
folly of being carried away by the witching arts
of pretty, graceful little creatures like Emma Guilford.
Perhaps the remembrance of the scene on
the railroad was some excuse for him; and it is
entirely unnecessary to apologize for anything a
beautiful girl may do, especially if she be the
daughter of a Senator. The young lady said a
great many pretty things, and the young gentleman
a great many smart ones, before she discovered
that the captain was wounded in the arm,
though she had already remarked upon his pale
face and rather attenuated form.
</p>
<p>He told her when and where he was wounded;
and of course she wanted to know all about his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
adventures in Secessia. He was as willing as
Othello to speak
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 22em;'>&#8220;Of most disastrous chances,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Of moving accidents, by flood and field;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Of hairbreadth scapes i&#8217; the imminent deadly breach;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Of being taken by the insolent foe.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>All this to hear did Emma Guilford seriously
incline. But he had hardly commenced the story
before the Senator himself entered the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Captain Somers, I am delighted to see
you!&#8221; said he with enthusiasm, as he extended his
hand, which our hero as warmly grasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. I have called to express my
obligations to you for all your kindness to me and
to my friend. Major de Banyan wished to be
kindly remembered to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to hear from the major; and as
for the rest, I feel that I have not yet begun to
discharge my obligation to you. Why didn&#8217;t you
write to me before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not wish to burden you with any remembrance
of such a humble individual as myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too modest by half, Captain Somers.
I should not have known anything about you if it
hadn&#8217;t been for General&mdash;&mdash; Well, no matter
who,&#8221; laughed the Senator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, papa, you have cut short the most interesting
story that ever was told!&#8221; interposed
Emma.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain must begin again, then. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
course, you will make my house your home while
in the city.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. I left my servant at the
hotel&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senator Guilford insisted on sending for the
servant and the baggage; and, in half an hour,
Alick was present to confirm the wonderful tale
which Somers told of his captivity in Petersburg,
to which Emma and her father listened with the
most intense interest.
</p>
<p>Very much to his surprise, Captain Somers
found himself quite a lion in Washington. He
was introduced to Senators and Representatives;
and on the following evening actually took the
President of the United States by the hand, just
as though he had been one of the patriarchs of
Pinchbrook.
</p>
<p>In spite of all these brilliant surroundings,
Somers was anxious to get home. He was too
feeble to endure the excitement of the capital; and
on the third day after his arrival, he started for
home. When he reached Boston, by an unfortunate
chance it was two hours before a train would
start for Pinchbrook. As he had spent two days
with a Senator in Washington, and shaken hands
with the President, he deemed himself qualified
to call at No. &mdash; Rutland Street, where the carriage
soon set him down.
</p>
<p>Lilian Ashford was at home; and Captain
Somers, who had faced a whole rebel brigade,
trembled and blushed in the presence of the maiden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
like the veriest coward in the world. But it was
some satisfaction to know that the other party was
similarly affected. The young hero could not exactly
explain how he felt. It was a different sensation
from that which had come over him in the
presence of Emma Guilford. He experienced a
feeling of awe before her, but he could talk as fast
as ever; while to Lilian he stammered, couldn&#8217;t remember
anything, and made woful confusion in
his words and in his ideas.
</p>
<p>When the ice was broken, he succeeded in telling
her something about his adventures in Virginia,
and roused a very strong desire in her mind
to see the wonderful Major de Banyan. But his
brief hour expired all too soon; it faded in a moment,
and seemed like a tale that was told.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wore your socks at the battles of Savage&#8217;s
Station, Glendale and White Oak Swamp, Miss
Ashford,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and I shall keep them for
future service of the same kind. If I am killed in
battle, I shall be found with those socks on my
feet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope you won&#8217;t be killed!&#8221; exclaimed
she with a shudder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope not; but, as soon as I am able, I
shall return to my duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a brave fellow you are! I shouldn&#8217;t
think you would dare to stand up before the cannons,
and the muskets, and the bayonets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I feel like running away, I always think
of my socks,&#8221; said Somers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>But the carriage had come for him, and Alick
stood at the door waiting for his appearance. He
took the little soft white hand in his own, and
readily promised, when she invited him, to call
again soon and see her grandmother, who was out
of town that day. Of course, Somers was deeply
interested in that venerable lady, and actually
looked forward with intense pleasure to the anticipated
visit.
</p>
<p>He was driven to the railroad station, and
reached Pinchbrook at &#8220;high twelve,&#8221; when the
Pinchbrookers were just going to their dinners.
Captain Barney, as usual, was at the depot, and
gave him a seaman&#8217;s welcome home. He insisted
upon being driven to the cottage before dinner;
and the old shipmaster, finding that Captain
Somers carried too many guns for him, gracefully
yielded the point.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my stars, if there ain&#8217;t Thomas!&#8221; cried
Mrs. Somers as she jumped up from the dinner-table,
and actually upset the teapot in the operation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, mother? How do you do,
father?&#8221; exclaimed the young captain as he shook
hands with his father and Gran&#8217;ther Green, kissed
his mother, and hugged his sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How pale you look, Thomas!&#8221; said his
mother. &#8220;I declare, you are as thin as a hatchet!
How is your arm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better, mother; I shall be as good as new in a
few days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You look pale; but your face is as nateral as
life,&#8221; said Gran&#8217;ther Green. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
we shall do with two cap&#8217;ns in the family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can manage that, gran&#8217;ther,&#8221; replied
Somers, as he took the place at the table which
had been prepared for him.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>We drop the curtain upon the scenes which followed;
for our patient reader can better imagine
than we can describe them. Our hero was once
more within the hallowed precincts of home; all
its sacred joys flowed in upon his soul; and he
thanked the good Father who had conducted him
through so many perils, and restored him to the
hearts of the loved ones who yearned for him in
his absence. They were as grateful for his return
as he was&mdash;grateful that God had restored him at
all; but doubly so that he had come with his soul
unstained by the vices of the camp and the wickedness
of the great world.
</p>
<p>The health of Captain Somers did not permit
his return to the army to participate in those great
battles before Washington in which his regiment
was reduced to a mere skeleton of its former self.
But, while the country was breathing slowly and
fearfully before the terrors of Lee&#8217;s invasion of
Maryland, there came to Pinchbrook a letter from
the gallant general of division&mdash;now in command
of a <i>corps d&#8217;armée</i>&mdash;under whom he had before
served, containing an appointment on his staff.
Though still but partially restored to health, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
hastened to accept his new position, and started at
once for the scene of strife.
</p>
<p>His suffering country needed him; and he could
not satisfy his sense of duty, even with the reasonable
excuse of a shattered physical frame. He
went, and his record was always honorable and
noble in success and in misfortune.
